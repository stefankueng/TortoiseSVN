Translations
------------

TortoiseSVN is still in development so
translations of all resources is also
a work 'in progress'.

To implement a new language for TortoiseSVN
follow these steps:

With VS.NET:
- get the sources from the repository
- start VS.NET, open the TortoiseSVN solution file
- create a new project: Win32, set it for dll.
  the project name should be "TortoiseProcXXX" where
  XXX is a three letter abreviation of your language
  (ENG for english, DEU for german, ...)
- in the project properties, Linker, Advanced change
  the setting "Resource Only Dll" to "yes (/NOENTRY)"
- also change the settings under "General" for the
  output directories to ../../bin/Debug and ../../bin/Release
  and for the intermediate directory to 
  ../../obj/Debug/TortoiseProcXXX and 
  ../../Release/TortoiseProcXXX.
- switch to the resource tab
- select all dialog resources from the main project
  (TortoiseProc)
- copy those resources to your new language project.
- also do that for the string resources
- now start translating the resources
- save your project
- compile your language project

- switch to the resource tab, select the string
  resources from TortoiseProc.
- right-click on the string resources, select
  "insert copy..." and make a copy for your
  language.
- translate the string resources

without VS.NET:
- make a copy of /src/TortoiseProc/TortoiseProc.rc
  and /src/TortoiseShell/resource.rc
- rename your copies to something with the
  language name in it.
- open those files in a text editor
- translate all texts
- save the files, zip them and send them to
  dev@tortoisesvn.tigris.org
