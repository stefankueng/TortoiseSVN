Translations
------------

TortoiseSVN is still in development so
translations of all resources is also
a work 'in progress'.

To implement a new language for TortoiseSVN
follow these steps:

Get the resource dll for translating from the download page.
The dlls are called "TortoiseLang.dll" and "TortoiseMergeLang.dll".

To translate the dlls you can use the program
SmartTranslator. You can get it from
http://www.codeproject.com/tools/smarttranslator.asp
(you need to register to be able to download the program)

Start this program and set up the paths. Don't forget
to add the *.dic to the dictionary path (it'll get created
for you). Then you _must_ set "english" as the target
language - that's a small issue with the program (it doesn't
move the version information to the target language).
Then start translating all strings and dialogs. You can
preview the dialogs by right clicking on the tree view
and select the entry in the context menu.
If you find that your translation doesn't fit at all
in a dialog please drop me a note.

And don't forget to add all your translated strings
to the dictionary! You have to do that manually
before pressing ok in the translation dialog!!!
If you don't do that then you'll have to translate
the same strings all over again in the next release.

As soon as you're finished translating you can
"build target" and create your own language dll.
Please rename that dll to
TortoiseProcXXXX.dll
where XXXX is the _decimal_ value of your language
ID - you can find the language ID's here:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/nls_238z.asp
Also note that the resulting dll is called
Tortoise'Proc', not Tortoise'Lang'.

Example:
English(US) is 0x409 --> 1033 as decimal value.

Then, copy your dll's to the language subfolder in the installation folder 
of TortoiseSVN (usually c:\program files\tortoisesvn\languages) and test it!

The last step: send the dll AND the dictionary file to the mailing list
(dev@tortoisesvn.tigris.org)
