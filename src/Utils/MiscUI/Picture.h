/**
 * \ingroup CommonClasses
 * Class for showing picture files. 
 * Use this class to show pictures of different file formats: BMP, DIB, EMF, GIF, ICO, JPG, WMF
 * If Gdi+ is installed (default on XP and later, optional on Win2k), other image formats can
 * be shown too: png, tiff.
 * The class uses the IPicture interface, the same way as internet explorer does.
 * 
 * Example of usage:
 * \code
 * CPicture m_picture;
 * //load picture data into the IPicture interface
 * m_picture.Load("Test.jpg");	//load from a file
 * m_picture.Load(IDR_TEST, "JPG");	//load from a resource
 * 
 * //when using in a dialog based application (CPaintDC dc(this);)
 * m_picture.UpdateSizeOnDC(&dc);	//get picture dimensions in pixels
 * m_picture.Show(&dc, CPoint(0,0), CPoint(m_picture.m_Width, m_picture.m_Height), 0, 0);
 * m_picture.Show(&dc, CRect(0,0,100,100)); //change original dimensions
 * m_picture.ShowBitmapResource(&dc, IDB_TEST, CPoint(0,0));	//show bitmap resource
 * 
 * //when using in a regular mfc application (CDC* pDC)
 * m_picture.UpdateSizeOnDC(pDC);	//get picture dimensions in pixels
 * m_picture.Show(pDC, CPoint(0,0), CPoint(m_picture.m_Width, m_picture.m_Height), 0, 0);
 * m_picture.Show(pDC, CRect(0,0,100,100)); //change original dimensions
 * m_picture.ShowBitmapResource(pDC, IDB_TEST, CPoint(0,0));	//show bitmap resource
 *
 * //to show picture information
 * std::string s;
 * s.Format("Size = %4d\nWidth = %4d\nHeight = %4d\nWeight = %4d\n",
 *				m_picture.m_Weigth, m_picture.m_Width, m_picture.m_Height, m_picture.m_Weight);
 * AfxMessageBox(s);
 * \endcode
 * \remark GDI+ is only used if it is installed. If you link with gdiplus.lib and mark the gdiplus.dll
 * as a delay-loaded dll, then your application won't throw an error if it isn't installed, but of course
 * png and tiff images can't be shown.
