/**
 * \ingroup Utils
 * Helper class for setting mouse cursors.\n
 * There are two ways of using this class:
 * -# Just declare a CCursor object with the
 *    required cursor. As soon as the object
 *    goes out of scope the previous cursor
 *    is restored.
 *    \code
 *    someMethod()
 *    {
 *      CCursor(IDC_WAIT);
 *      //do something here
 *    }
 *    //now CCursor is out of scope and the default cursor is restored
 *    \endcode
 * -# use the object the usual way. Declare a CCursor object
 *    and use the methods to set the cursors.
 *
 * \remark the class can be used on Win95 and NT4 too, but the
 * hand cursor won't be available.
 *
 * \par requirements
 * win98 or later\n
 * win2k or later\n
 * MFC\n
 *
 * \version 1.0
 * first version
