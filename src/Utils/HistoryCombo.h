/**
 * \ingroup Utils
 * Extends the CComboBoxEx class with a history of entered
 * values. An example of such a combobox is the Start/Run
 * dialog which lists the programs you used last in a combobox.
 * To use this class do the following:
 * -# add both files HistoryCombo.h and HistoryCombo.cpp to your project.
 * -# add a ComboBoxEx to your dialog
 * -# create a variable for the ComboBox of type control
 * -# change the type of the created variable from CComboBoxEx to
 *    CHistoryCombo
 * -# in your OnInitDialog() call SetURLHistory(TRUE) if your ComboBox
 *    contains URLs
 * -# in your OnInitDialog() call the LoadHistory() method
 * -# in your OnOK() or somewhere similar call the SaveHistory() method
 * 
 * thats it.
