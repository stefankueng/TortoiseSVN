Instructions to build an installer for TortoiseSVN:

Note: I assume that you already have compiled
Subversion and TortoiseSVN before. If not please
follow the instructions in build.txt.

- get either a subversion source tarball or
  switch your working copy to the latest
  release tag.
- check if there are new versions of
  neon
  apache webserver
  openssl
  zlib
  and download/build them if needed.
- run > python gen-make.py -t vcproj --with-openssl=path\to\openssl --with-zlib=path\to\zlib
  in the Subversion directory
- double click on the file subversion_vcnet.sln
  and rebuild the project __ALL__
- check out the latest version of TortoiseSVN
  directly from the Subversion repository.
- edit the file version.h and change all version
  defines to the new version
- edit the Changelog.txt
- Compile TortoiseSVN
- Build the Installer project twice, once
  with "release" and once with "release_mbcs".
- Now test the installer and TortoiseSVN.
- upload both *.msi files to the filesharing
  area on the TortoiseSVN website.
- zip the source tree of TortoiseSVN and
  remove all temporary files. Only the files
  under source control should be in the zip.
- upload the source-zip to the filesharing
  area on the TortoiseSVN website.
- Write a news entry on the website.
- Change the TortoiseSVN website to reflect
  the new release.
- commit the website changes.
- write a mail to dev@tortoisesvn.tigris.org
  and announce@tortoisesvn.tigris.org to
  announce the new release. Include the list
  of changes since the last release in those
  mails.
