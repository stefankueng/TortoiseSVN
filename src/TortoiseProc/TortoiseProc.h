/**
 * \ingroup TortoiseProc
 * Main class of the TortoiseProc.exe\n
 * It is the entry point when calling the TortoiseProc.exe and
 * handles the command line. Depending on the command line
 * other 'modules' are called, usually dialog boxes which 
 * themselves then execute a specific function.\n\n
 * Many commands are executed using the CSVNProgressDlg which
 * just displays the common notify callbacks of the Subversion commands.
 *
 * \par requirements
 * win95 or later
 * winNT4 or later
 * MFC
 *
 * \version 1.0
 * first version
