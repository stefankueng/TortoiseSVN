/**
 * \ingroup TortoiseProc
 * This is the container for all settings pages. A setting page is
 * a class derived from CPropertyPage with an additional method called
 * SaveData(). The SaveData() method is used by the dialog to save
 * the settings the user has made - if that method is not called then
 * it means that the changes are discarded! Each settings page has
 * to make sure that no changes are saved outside that method.
 *
 * \par requirements
 * win95 or later
 * winNT4 or later
 * MFC

 * \version 1.0
