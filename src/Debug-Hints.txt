Debugging hints

Since TortoiseSVN is a shell extension it's not
as easy to debug as normal applications. The
TortoiseShell part is only a dll which is 
loaded by the windows explorer. So the first
thing you need to do is:

- add the following value to the registry:
  HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\DesktopProcess
  (REG_DWORD) = 1
  This will tell windows to start each explorer
  in a separate process instead of one single
  process.
- register the TortoiseShell dll so that
  the windows explorer loads it. There are
  three files in the folder src\TortoiseShell
  with extension *.registry. Make a copy of
  those files and change the extension to
  *.reg. Then you have to edit those three
  files so that the paths in it reflects
  your source paths exactly.
  Now if you doubleclick on register.reg 
  the debug version of the TortoiseSVN.dll
  gets registered. registerrelease.reg 
  registers the release version of the
  TortoiseSVN.dll. Don't do it right now!
- Start VS.NET and load the TortoiseSVN
  solution file. Set the TortoiseShell
  project as "startup project".
- Close all running instances of windows
  explorer.
- Now execute the register.reg file. Since
  you already closed all explorer windows
  you'll have to use the windows start
  button, then execute, enter the location
  of the reg file and hit enter.
  Since this is a lot of clicking I made
  a shortcut of those files in the quickstart
  on the taskbar.
- Hit F5 in the VS.NET IDE (or start
  debugging via menu). The first time
  you do that VS.NET will ask you to
  enter an application to use with the
  TortoiseSVN.dll - enter c:\windows\explorer.exe
  (or whatever path it is on your system).
- Now you can set breakpoints and debug
  as you like.
- Don't stop debugging by closing the
  explorer window - this sometimes leads
  to a locked dll and you can't compile/link
  the dll again until you have restarted.
  Always stop debugging with the command
  in the VS.NET IDE (Shift-F5).
- After debugging, execute the file
  deregister.reg. Do this always _immediately_
  after debugging or you might get a locked
  dll.
- while debugging, _never_ start another
  explorer instance or internet explorer
  or any other application which uses
  explorer - this includes already running
  applications to open dialogs like "save as"!

To debug the TortoiseProc part of TortoiseSVN
proceed as with any normal application.

To debug the TSVNCache exit the TSVNCache.exe
process and proceed as with any normal
application. Exiting TSVNCache.exe is necessary
because only one instance of TSVNCache may run
at a time. To exit the TSVNCache process set
HKCU\Software\TortoiseSVN\CacheTrayIcon to 1 and
call "Exit" in the context menu of the tray icon.
