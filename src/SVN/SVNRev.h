/**
 * \ingroup SVN
 * SVNRev represents a subversion revision. A subversion revision can
 * be either a simple revision number, a date or a string with one
 * of the following keywords:
 * - BASE
 * - COMMITTED
 * - PREV
 * - HEAD
 *
 * For convenience, this class also accepts the string "WC" as a
 * keyword for the working copy revision.
 *
 * Right now, this class also accepts those "special" revisions
 * as a normal revision number. This is just for convenience to stay
 * compatible with the current implementation in TortoiseSVN, but
 * will be removed soon!
 *
 * \par requirements
 * win95 or later
 * winNT4 or later
 * MFC
 *
 * \version 1.0
 * first version
 *
 * \date MAR-2004
 *
 * \author Stefan Kueng
 *
 * \par license
 * This code is absolutely free to use and modify. The code is provided "as is" with
 * no expressed or implied warranty. The author accepts no liability if it causes
 * any damage to your computer, causes your pet to fall ill, increases baldness
 * or makes your car start emitting strange noises when you start it up.
 * This code has no bugs, just undocumented features!
