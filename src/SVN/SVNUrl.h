/**
 * \ingroup TortoiseProc
 * SVNUrl is a specialized CString class which is aware of Subversion URLs.
 * In addition to the normal conventions for URLs, SVNUrls may include a
 * revision information in the form "PATH?REV".
 *
 * This class accepts both the unescaped or escaped form of a SVNUrl.
 * However, it always stores the unescaped form. To get the escaped form
 * of the path part of the SVNUrl, use GetPath() with the \a escaped
 * parameter set to TRUE.
 *
 * \par requirements
 * win95 or later
 * winNT4 or later
 * MFC
 *
 * \version 1.0
 * first version
 *
 * \date MAR-2004
 *
 * \author Thomas Epting

 * \par license
 * This code is absolutely free to use and modify. The code is provided "as is" with
 * no expressed or implied warranty. The author accepts no liability if it causes
 * any damage to your computer, causes your pet to fall ill, increases baldness
 * or makes your car start emitting strange noises when you start it up.
 * This code has no bugs, just undocumented features!
