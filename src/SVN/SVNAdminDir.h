/**
 * \ingroup SVN
 * This class implements one global object, handling the Subversion admin
 * directory and functions used with that.
 * 
 * The global object is g_SVNAdminDir, defined as an external in this header
 * file, and declared once in the cpp file.
 *
 * When the global object is created, apr is initialized, a pool is created
 * and the Subversion admin directory name is set. That name then stays the same
 * as long as the object exists.
 * 
 * The name of the admin dir is determined by reading the environment variable
 * SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK. If that variable exists, the admin dir name is set
 * to "_svn", otherwise it is the default ".svn".
 *
 * Since some applications (like TortoiseProc.exe) clear *all* pools at the end,
 * this object has a Close() method to make it clean up the pool at a defined
 * time. Otherwise it will clean up the pool when the object is destroyed, which
 * isn't done at a defined time for global objects.
