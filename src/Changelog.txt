CVS
- BUG: if all files were deselected in the commit
       dialog then the progress dialog couldn't be
       closed anymore. (Stefan)
- BUG: Resizing of dialogs didn't work correctly
       so I changed the resizing system (Stefan)
- CHG: Repository browser now has a minimal size
       so that resizing works better. (Stefan)
       
       
Version 0.10.0
- BUG: if several files are selected for committing
       and the first one is unversioned or just
       added a crash occured (Stefan)
- BUG: if a folder was renamed in a working copy
       with a system rename (not a 'svn rename')
       then explorer crashed. Issue 39. (Stefan)
- BUG: if an error occured while reading the
       config file it wasn't reported. (Stefan)
- BUG: the settings page crashed if not all pages
       were selected before hitting "ok". (Stefan)
- BUG: copy/paste and drag'n'drop of unversioned
       files could crash explorer. (Stefan)
- BUG: import with "use foldername as modulename"
       didn't work, the modulename was some random
       characters. (Stefan)
- BUG: The check for temporary files when doing an
       import wasn't able to delete those. (Stefan)
- BUG: The disk drive now shouldn't be scanned
       anymore if (in the settings) the icon
       overlays for removable drives is turned off.
       (Stefan)
- BUG: Pathnames weren't correctly converted for
       checkouts. (Stefan)
- ADD: in the settings page there's now an option
       if the user wants to have unversioned files
       shown before a commit so (s)he can add it
       before the commit. (Stefan)
- ADD: the add dialog now shows the files with
       the relative path so the user can better
       check if a file needs to be added or not.
       This is especially usefull if folders
       are added. (Stefan)
- ADD: Two new column providers: one for the URL
       of subversion files/folders and the other
       for a shortened URL without the server
       and file part. (Stefan)
- ADD: new icons (Luebbe)
- CHG: before obtaining a subversion status we
       now first check if an .svn directory
       exists - this should speed up things
       a little. (Stefan)
- CHG: In the commit dialog the focus is now
       set to the edit control where the user
       enters the log message. (Stefan)
- CHG: adjusted the messagebox colors to system
       colors. (Stefan)
- CHG: The green color in the progress dialog
       got replaced with the system color for
       selection background. The red color is
       still hardcoded - I think users who set
       the dialog background to red are crazy
       anyway :) (Stefan)
- CHG: exchanged positions of the ok and 
       cancel button on popular request (Stefan).

- BUG: The coloring in the progress dialog was wrong 
       if the wc contained svn:externals (Stefan)
- BUG: TortoiseSVN wasn't working on Win98-based
       systems anymore 'cause we now use UNICODE.
       So changed the code to compile for either
       MBCS _or_ UNICODE. This means we have
       to provide two binary versions of TSVN 
       from now on (Stefan)
- CHG: The menu items now are properly aligned
       for both with and without icons (Stefan)
- CHG: merge/tag uses again an url->url copy
       command instead of a wc->url copy since
       this doesn't work for working copy root
       folders. (Stefan)

Version 0.9.1
- BUG: the zlib dll lead to some crashes, so
       I went back to statically linked zlib (Stefan)

       file was in the folder (Stefan)
- ADD: in the commit dialog (logprompt) there's now
       a label showing to where the commit goes so
       the user can see if (s)he committing to
       a branch or trunk (or worse: to a tag) (Stefan)
- ADD: in the "show log" dialog its now possible to
       select two revisions and the context menu then
       allows to compare those two revisions (Stefan)

       removed and moved files added (Stefan)

       an error the log message is preserved (Stefan)

       dialog starts the external diff program so you
       can see the changes you made to the files
       before committing (Stefan)
- ADD: The temporary file mask now can have wildcards
       like ? and * too. (Stefan)
- ADD: Icon overlays can now be disabled for different
       drive types (Stefan)
- CHG: the ok button is disabled in the show log dialog
       while popup-commands are executed (Stefan)
- CHG: when committing, only files in versioned dirs are
       shown to the user for adding before the commit
       occurs (Stefan)
- CHG: order in which the files are passed to the diff
       program (Stefan)
- CHG: the icon overlay should now be faster. This 
       affects mostly big directories but smaller ones
       should profit from it too. (Stefan)
- CHG: converted both projects (shell and main part)
       to UNICODE. This to support non-ANSI characters
       both for viewing and entering. This also solves
       Issue 37. (Stefan)

       instead of HKLM (Stefan)

       repository browser button was disabled forever. (Stefan)
- BUG: if the repository browser was used a second time then
       the icons of the items were gone. (Stefan)
- BUG: the history combo now works as expected (Stefan)
- CHG: in the switch dialog now the 'switch to branch'
       checkbox is removed since the 'update to revision'
       command does exactly this. (Stefan)
- CHG: the copy command now uses the progess dialog (Stefan)
- CHG: use always wc->url in copy command (Stefan)

- ADD: If the user selects two files then there's now a "Diff"
       entry in the submenu which starts the external diff program
       on those two files. It's not required that the two files
       be under version control - it works on every two files.
       This is a handy and fast way to see the diff. (Stefan)
- ADD: delete and rename command has now an own menu icon (Stefan)
- BUG: the "save as..." dialog didn't show up under NT4 'cause
       of the changed size of OPENFILENAME structure (Stefan)

       or (if not checked) if the contents of the folder 
       should be imported directly to the url. (Stefan)
- ADD: if the user selects a directory for "Add" then
       a dialog shows up showing all unversioned items
