- BUG: The conflicted files weren't always determined
       correctly. (Stefan)
- BUG: The settings page for the menu layout set the
       settings to the default values if the page
       wasn't selected. (Dimentiy)
- BUG: File-entries in the log dialog could not be
       selected if the message contained more than
       three lines. (Stefan)
- CHG: The "rename" command now uses the --force option
       by default so that modified files can be renamed
       too. (Stefan)
- CHG: The log dialog got minimize/maximize buttons. (Stefan)
- ADD: Log messages selectable to copy them to the
       clipboard (with Ctrl-C). Issue 64. (Stefan)

Version 0.18
- BUG: The repository browser didn't escape the url
       sequences. (Stefan)
- BUG: Explorer could crash when doing a column sort
       on really big working copies. Thanks a lot
       to Lübbe for helping in finding this bug. (Stefan)
- BUG: Some parts of the log message itself were selectable
       in the log dialog. (Stefan)
- CHG: Removed the limitation for property lengths
       in the property page. (Stefan)
- CHG: Status text from "unversioned" to "non-versioned".
       (Stefan)
- ADD: A new entry in the main settings page can be
       used to tell TSVN to reuse the entered log-message
       in the commit dialog even if the user cancelles
       the dialog. This was a user request. (Stefan)
- ADD: New right-drag command to copy files/folders
       inside a working copy. (Stefan)
- ADD: Ask the user for external programs if none
       is specified in the settings. Also if no WinDiff
       like program is found do a unified diff and show
       that in a text-editor. (Stefan)
- ADD: The context menu layout is configurable from
       the settings dialog. (Stefan)
- ADD: Use of the new prompting providers of subversion,
       this means TSVN now uses more specific dialogs
       to ask questions about authentication and
       ssl certificates. (Stefan)

Version 0.17
- BUG: the "Add" and "Add to ignore list" commands were
       shown even if there was no working copy. (Stefan)
- CHG: URL's are shown unescaped now, at least everywhere
       where they can't be edited. (Stefan)
- CHG: Follow the drive type settings: don't access
       drives which are not used. (Stefan)
- CHG: If there's nothing to commit, a dialog box
       pops up telling that. After that the main
       dialog is also closed so no more pressing
       "OK" or "Cancel" for nothing. (Stefan)
- CHG: The property page uses the XP visual styles
       on windows XP. (Stefan)
- ADD: The "Browse..." Button in the relocate dialog
       works now. (Stefan)
- ADD: Maximize button on the progress window. (Stefan)
- ADD: The resulting revision number is shown when
       doing commits, copies/tags, ... (Stefan)
- ADD: You can now enter a log message when doing an
       branch/tag. Fixes issue 63. (Stefan)
- ADD: Information about a successful tag in the log
       dialog. (Stefan)
- ADD: Exporting directly from an URL. (Stefan)
       
Version 0.16
- BUG: The "open" command in the repository browser
       was always active, even for URL's which 
       can't be opened. (Stefan)
- BUG: Two more dialogs (Updates and Commit) were
       missing the new subversion statuses. (Stefan)
- BUG: The proxy parameters were stored under the wrong
       key in the registry. (Stefan)
- BUG: In Import, if no temporary files were found
       or all deselected then an error message
       was shown. (Stefan)
- BUG: In the log dialog if more than 500 files were
       changed in a revision then it showed "and 0 more"
       instead of the real remaining files. (Stefan)
- CHG: Changed the behaviour of the Log and Updates
       dialog if a network timeout occured. (Stefan)
- CHG: If the option "recursive overlays" is not set
       then the status for folders is always set to
       "normal" to speed things up a little. (Stefan)
- CHG: Added a timeout to the status cache. This
       is a workaround so that refreshing (pressing
       F5) isn't needed that much. (Stefan)
- CHG: Improved the status caching. (Stefan)
- CHG: if only the properties were modified then
       this is indicated by a "(P only)" in
       the status text in the commit dialog. (Stefan)
- ADD: The column provider uses now it's own status
       cache. (Stefan)
- ADD: Norwegian translation. (Jostein Andersen)

Version 0.15.2
- BUG: The "Check for updates" dialog could
       crash for unversioned items. (Stefan)
- BUG: Subversion got new statuses which I
       completely missed. (Stefan)
- BUG: in the changed dialog if an entry was selected
       but no menu entry chosen then the 
       OK button stayed disabled. (Stefan)
- BUG: It wasn't possible to add more than two files
       to the ignore list. (Stefan)
- ADD: New context menu in the "Check for updates"
       dialog: compare with working copy. (Stefan)

Version 0.15.1
- BUG: Making a copy didn't always work. Some 
       Pre-Commit-Hooks prevent too short
       log messages. (Stefan)
- BUG: Wrong error message was shown if the
       external diff viewer could not be
       started. (Stefan)
- ADD: In the "Check for updates" dialog two context
       menus for showing a diff and updating files
       and folders. (Stefan)
- ADD: The proxy-settings are saved even if they
       are disabled. That way you can enable/disable
       those settings without the need to always
       reenter the data. (Stefan)

Version 0.15
- BUG: right-dragging a single file/folder resulted
       in error message "cannot copy path ... into
       its own child ...". (Stefan)
- BUG: The log dialog could crash if not enough
       memory is available. (Stefan)
- ADD: Select the files you want to delete before
       importing a project. (Stefan)
- ADD: New command "ignore" to set the svn:ignore
       property for selected files. This addition also
       includes the necessary changes for other 
       commands to respect the ignored status of
       subversioned files. This fixes 
       issues 38 and 60. (Stefan)
- ADD: While moving files inside a working copy
       a progress dialog is shown. (Stefan)

Version 0.14
- BUG: A Path inside a local repository wasn't recognized
       as a valid repo path in the repository browser. 
       Fixes Issue 56. (Stefan)
- BUG: Fixed issue 54. (Stefan)
- BUG: The dependency of SHGetFolderPathA in shell32.dll
       is removed so TSVN works again on NT4/Win98. (Stefan)
- BUG: renaming didn't work. (Stefan)
- BUG: The drag'n'drop-handler didn't work. (Stefan)
- BUG: The log for a renamed file/folder was shown
       as two deletes instead of a delete and an add. (Stefan)
- BUG: URL were not escaped. Issue 58. (Stefan)
- CHG: Some icons are changed, some new. (Lübbe)
- CHG: If a file is deleted from the filesystem but not
       removed from version control the icon overlay
       shows the "deleted" icon. (Stefan)
- ADD: In the log dialog a new context menu entry
       for creating a tag from a specific revision.
       This solves issue 53. (Stefan)
- ADD: In the log dialog there's a context menu
       in the list of changed files to show the
       changes you made to that file in that
       revision. Solves issue 55. (Stefan)
- ADD: Added another context menu entry to the
       log dialog for creating a unified diff
       file (patch file) and showing that
       inside an external viewer. (Stefan)
- ADD: revert changes of a specific revision in
       the log dialog. (Stefan)
- ADD: New command to check for updates on the
       server. (Stefan)

Version 0.12.1
- BUG: If an error occurred while executing a command
       in the log dialog the ok button wasn't reenabled
       again. (Stefan)
- BUG: Some with the file:/// prefix paths could crash 
       the repository browser. (Stefan)
- BUG: Fixed typo in the conflict editor hint box. (Stefan)
- CHG: Changed some german translations. (Stefan)
- CHG: The Language Combo in the settings page is
       increased in size for all languages. (Stefan)
- CHG: reorganized the submenu. (Stefan)
- CHG: The installer doesn't contain the debug symbols
       and the crashhandler anymore. They can be downloaded
       separately. (Stefan)
- ADD: The About dialog shows which version of TSVN is
       installed (UNICODE or MBCS) in the window title. (Stefan)
- ADD: A new command which starts the default browser
       with the daily use guide. (Stefan)
              
Version 0.12
- BUG: hopefully fixed the bug in the repository-
       browser when using paths with four/five
       slashes. (Stefan)
- BUG: fixed some bugs in the repository browser. (Stefan)
- BUG: deselecting a file inside a folder in the
       add dialog lead to deactivation of _all_
       files which started with the same path, even
       if they weren't in the same folder. (Stefan)
- BUG: menu entries were shown twice for "link" files
       like .lnk and .rdp. This solves issue 52. (Stefan)
- BUG: the merge function wasn't working correctly since
       no revisions were used. (Stefan)
- CHG: the log command now has the strict-option
       set to false instead of true. (Stefan)
- CHG: time/date is now shown using the local
       format. This solves issue 49. (Stefan)
- CHG: removed dependency to msimg32.dll. (Stefan)
- CHG: the commit dialog shows the modified files
       with path. (Stefan)
- CHG: the rename dialog allows only to rename and
       not to move anymore. To move files do a right
       drag in explorer. (Stefan)
- CHG: in the show-log dialog only the first 50
       files that were changed are listed to reduce
       memory consumption. (Stefan)
- ADD: repository browser works with svn://
       svn+ssl:// (Stefan)
- ADD: enhanced the repository browser with a
       popup-menu containing commands like
       "show log", "save as..." and "open". (Stefan)
- ADD: new menu entry to start an external merge
       program, including parameters. (Stefan)
- ADD: the "temporary file mask" can now contain
       folders (marked with a backslash at the end)
       and has a positive list (marked with a 
       plus sign "+" in front). So you are now
       able to specify something like
       "+readme.txt;*.txt;cvs\" which will allow
       the file readme.txt but deny all other *.txt
       files, and will deny all folders and files within
       a folder named "cvs". 
       Please note that the order is from left
       to right - so "*.txt;+readme.txt" will deny
       all *.txt files, the readme.txt will also
       be denied since it has lower priority than
       the *.txt match. (Stefan)
- ADD: before doing a merge TSVN checks if the
       working copy has uncommitted changes
       and shows an error message if it has. (Stefan)
- ADD: if a file has been deleted in the explorer but
       not in version control then the commit dialog
       lets the user select those files and they
       will be deleted from version control before
       the commit. (Stefan)
- ADD: better caching of subversion statuses. (Stefan)
- ADD: two new icon overlays for status "deleted"
       and for status "added". (Stefan)
- ADD: new command "relocate". (Stefan)

Version 0.11.2
- BUG: entering the settings page without
       activating the icon overlay page
       resulted in complete loss of 
       overlay settings if other changes
       were saved. (Stefan)
- BUG: in our own caching provider the
       username/password wasn't initialized
       on the first attempt - this lead to
       undetermined behaviour and crashes!
       (Stefan)
- CHG: some minor GUI changes in the property
       page for the explorer, according to
       the hint from Dimentiy. (Stefan)
- CHG: the url in the property page is no
       longer compacted. (Stefan)

Version 0.11.0
- BUG: if all files were deselected in the commit
       dialog then the progress dialog couldn't be
       closed anymore. (Stefan)
- BUG: Resizing of dialogs didn't work correctly
       so I changed the resizing system (Stefan)
- BUG: corrected tooltip in the checkout dialog (Stefan)
- BUG: for network paths TSVN created a file:// path
       with five instead of four slashes. (Stefan)
- CHG: Repository browser now has a minimal size
       so that resizing works better. (Stefan)
- CHG: if the checkout directory is left empty
       then the OK button is now disabled (Stefan)
- CHG: if no valid path is given then the
       repository browser opens now on the
       desktop by default. (Stefan)
- CHG: unified interface elements. Issue 45. (Stefan)
- CHG: made the menu entries align with others. (Stefan)
- CHG: the menu icons are still ownerdrawn, but
       if the registry entry 
       (DWORD)HKCU\Software\TortoiseSVN\OwnerdrawnMenus
       is set to 0 (zero) then TortoiseSVN uses
       the system to draw the icons. (Stefan)       
- ADD: Translation to russian language added (Dimentiy).
- ADD: in the property page it's now possible to
       select and copy/paste the information. This
       fixes issue 46. (Stefan)
- ADD: After creating a repository now a messagebox
       appears to inform the user of the finished
       command. (Stefan)
- ADD: new menu entry in the log dialog: it's now
       possible to "update to revision" with a
       right click on a specific revision log
       entry. Issue 44. (Stefan)
- ADD: the about box now contains the version
       of subversion TortoiseSVN is linked
       against. Issue 43. (Stefan)
- ADD: TSVN now has it's own caching provider.
       That means that username/password are
       cached during an active session, i.e.
       as long as a dialog is open. This prevents
       the user from entering username/password
       multiple times in the repository browser. (Stefan)
- ADD: the repository browser now always shows
       the full path so the user can select
       elements "above" the one initially entered.
       This fixes issue 47 (but not with an "up"
       button). (Stefan)
       
Version 0.10.0
- BUG: if several files are selected for committing
       and the first one is unversioned or just
       added a crash occured (Stefan)
- BUG: if a folder was renamed in a working copy
       with a system rename (not a 'svn rename')
       then explorer crashed. Issue 39. (Stefan)
- BUG: if an error occured while reading the
       config file it wasn't reported. (Stefan)
- BUG: the settings page crashed if not all pages
       were selected before hitting "ok". (Stefan)
- BUG: copy/paste and drag'n'drop of unversioned
       files could crash explorer. (Stefan)
- BUG: import with "use foldername as modulename"
       didn't work, the modulename was some random
       characters. (Stefan)
- BUG: The check for temporary files when doing an
       import wasn't able to delete those. (Stefan)
- BUG: The disk drive now shouldn't be scanned
       anymore if (in the settings) the icon
       overlays for removable drives is turned off.
       (Stefan)
- BUG: Pathnames weren't correctly converted for
       checkouts. (Stefan)
- ADD: in the settings page there's now an option
       if the user wants to have unversioned files
       shown before a commit so (s)he can add it
       before the commit. (Stefan)
- ADD: the add dialog now shows the files with
       the relative path so the user can better
       check if a file needs to be added or not.
       This is especially usefull if folders
       are added. (Stefan)
- ADD: Two new column providers: one for the URL
       of subversion files/folders and the other
       for a shortened URL without the server
       and file part. (Stefan)
- ADD: new icons (Luebbe)
- CHG: before obtaining a subversion status we
       now first check if an .svn directory
       exists - this should speed up things
       a little. (Stefan)
- CHG: In the commit dialog the focus is now
       set to the edit control where the user
       enters the log message. (Stefan)
- CHG: adjusted the messagebox colors to system
       colors. (Stefan)
- CHG: The green color in the progress dialog
       got replaced with the system color for
       selection background. The red color is
       still hardcoded - I think users who set
       the dialog background to red are crazy
       anyway :) (Stefan)
- CHG: exchanged positions of the ok and 
       cancel button on popular request (Stefan).

Version 0.9.2
- BUG: In the Add dialog unversioned folders
       with items in it lead to a crash (Stefan)
- BUG: removed the unused "Help" button from the 
       settings page (Stefan)
- BUG: The coloring in the progress dialog was wrong 
       if the wc contained svn:externals (Stefan)
- BUG: TortoiseSVN wasn't working on Win98-based
       systems anymore 'cause we now use UNICODE.
       So changed the code to compile for either
       MBCS _or_ UNICODE. This means we have
       to provide two binary versions of TSVN 
       from now on (Stefan)
- CHG: The menu items now are properly aligned
       for both with and without icons (Stefan)
- CHG: merge/tag uses again an url->url copy
       command instead of a wc->url copy since
       this doesn't work for working copy root
       folders. (Stefan)

Version 0.9.1
- BUG: the zlib dll lead to some crashes, so
       I went back to statically linked zlib (Stefan)
- BUG: The prompt dialog for log messages wasn't
       resized properly. (Stefan)
- BUG: The check for temp files was case aware (Stefan)
       
Version 0.9 (Subversion 0.21, rev 5631)
- BUG: in some dialog the repository browser button
       was disabled (Stefan)
- BUG: the "show log" menu was shown even if there
       were multiple files selected (Stefan)
- BUG: icon overlays weren't shown correctly if only
       the properties changed (Stefan)
- BUG: revision numbers weren't correct for HEAD (Stefan)
- BUG: workaround for strange apr behaviour when 
       opening a file with WRITE|CREATE (Stefan)
- BUG: import dialog ignored the "use foldername
       as modulename" checkbox (Stefan)
- BUG: repository browser now works for https URLs (Stefan)
- BUG: import and commit log messages were limited
       in number of lines (Stefan)
- BUG: files matching the temporary extensions were
       not added even if the user explicitely selected
       them for adding. (Stefan)
- BUG: The folder icon overlay dissapeared if the
       svn:ignored property was set and an ignored
       file was in the folder (Stefan)
- ADD: in the commit dialog (logprompt) there's now
       a label showing to where the commit goes so
       the user can see if (s)he committing to
       a branch or trunk (or worse: to a tag) (Stefan)
- ADD: in the "show log" dialog its now possible to
       select two revisions and the context menu then
       allows to compare those two revisions (Stefan)
- ADD: browse button for merge dialog (Stefan)
- ADD: log messages now have a list of the changed/added
       removed and moved files added (Stefan)
- ADD: tooltips for import and checkout dialog (Stefan)
- ADD: the user can now decide for each authentication
       prompt if (s)he wants to save it or not (Stefan)
- ADD: if import or commit get interrupted 'cause of
       an error the log message is preserved (Stefan)
- ADD: a doubleclick on the file list in the commit
       dialog starts the external diff program so you
       can see the changes you made to the files
       before committing (Stefan)
- ADD: The temporary file mask now can have wildcards
       like ? and * too. (Stefan)
- ADD: Icon overlays can now be disabled for different
       drive types (Stefan)
- CHG: the ok button is disabled in the show log dialog
       while popup-commands are executed (Stefan)
- CHG: when committing, only files in versioned dirs are
       shown to the user for adding before the commit
       occurs (Stefan)
- CHG: order in which the files are passed to the diff
       program (Stefan)
- CHG: the icon overlay should now be faster. This 
       affects mostly big directories but smaller ones
       should profit from it too. (Stefan)
- CHG: converted both projects (shell and main part)
       to UNICODE. This to support non-ANSI characters
       both for viewing and entering. This also solves
       Issue 37. (Stefan)
- CHG: the temp file mask is now stored under HKCU
       instead of HKLM (Stefan)

Version 0.8.1
- BUG: the add menu was missing for single files (Stefan)
- BUG: the "update to revision" command updated always to HEAD
       (Stefan)
- BUG: if the user selected unversioned items for updating
       then TSVN could crash (Stefan)
- BUG: in the copy dialog the error message from subversion
       was not shown (only the beep was heard). (Stefan)
- BUG: if the user pressed "Cancel" in the authentication
       dialog then still another retry was made (Stefan)
- BUG: if the URL in the combobox was deleted then the
       repository browser button was disabled forever. (Stefan)
- BUG: if the repository browser was used a second time then
       the icons of the items were gone. (Stefan)
- BUG: the history combo now works as expected (Stefan)
- CHG: in the switch dialog now the 'switch to branch'
       checkbox is removed since the 'update to revision'
       command does exactly this. (Stefan)
- CHG: the copy command now uses the progess dialog (Stefan)
- CHG: use always wc->url in copy command (Stefan)
- ADD: the progress dialog now shows the different actions
       in color. Also it now shows directly if during an
       update a file gets conflicted or merged. (Stefan)
- ADD: cancellation for the log command. (Stefan)
- ADD: the branch/tag dialog now shows from which URL the
       branch/tag is made. (Stefan)
- ADD: a 'browse repository' button in the switch dialog (Stefan)
- ADD: "show log" now in the TSVN submenu too (Stefan)

Version 0.8
- CHG: most used commands are now in the top context menu and
       not in the submenu anymore (Stefan)
- CHG: Modified the SVN Progress dialog so that the columns are
       resized before any data is added. Also ensured that all
       items are *entirely* visible even if the horizontal scroll
       bar is visible. (Damian)
- CHG: icon for cleanup command (Stefan)
- ADD: drag and drop handler for adding files to a working copy
       and for moving files inside a working copy (Stefan)
- ADD: the commit dialog now shows all unversioned files
       and lets the user select them to add before committing,
       issue #22 (Stefan)
- ADD: A browse for folder button to the Checkout dialog.
       Modified the initial value of the checkout directory field
       contain the current working directory (InitInstanceMade
       method of the CTortoiseProcApp class). (Damian)
- ADD: If the user selects two files then there's now a "Diff"
       entry in the submenu which starts the external diff program
       on those two files. It's not required that the two files
       be under version control - it works on every two files.
       This is a handy and fast way to see the diff. (Stefan)
- ADD: delete and rename command has now an own menu icon (Stefan)
