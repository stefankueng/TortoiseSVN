
               TortoiseSVN, a windows shell integration for Subversion
               =======================================================

This file serves as a wish list for features TortoiseSVN should
provide in the future. But not only concrete wishes get in here
but also just ideas. Therefore this file is never sorted... :)


- QueriInfo extension which provides additional information about
  the subversion status of the files. Needs to call the previous
  QueriInfo-handler to avoid loosing specific file-type information
- find a way to show the subversion status of files/directories
  like 'svn status -u' to indicate changes in the repository
- configure Subversion settings from TortoiseSVN, auto-detect windows proxy settings (Edward S Marshall)
