- Install Python 2.2. You can get it from here:
  http://www.python.org/windows/
- Install Perl. Get it from http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/
- create a new folder on your harddisk, e.g. SVN.
  Now checkout the subversion source into this folder
  svn co http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk Subversion
  Or if you're using TortoiseSVN to checkout the sources
  then right-click into the SVN folder and select "checkout".
  In the dialog enter the URL and add "\Subversion" to
  the checkout path.
- Download the compiled berkeley db library from
  the TortoiseSVN download area:
  http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=616
  and unzip it to SVN\Subversion\db4-win32
- Download the newest source of the apache server
  for windows from http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi
  Unzip the sources into SVN\Subversion
  Open a DOS-Box in the SVN directory and type:
  > perl httpd-2.0.48\srclib\apr-util\build\w32locatedb.pl dll db4-win32\include db4-win32\lib
  (if your copy of apr doesn't have the file w32locatedb.pl in it, you can
  get it from http://subversion.tigris.org/files/documents/15/8705/w32locatedb.pl)
  Then copy (not move) the folders
  SVN\Subversion\httpd-2.0.xx\srclib\apr to SVN\Subversion\apr
  SVN\Subversion\httpd-2.0.xx\srclib\apr-iconv to SVN\Subversion\apr-iconv
  SVN\Subversion\httpd-2.0.xx\srclib\apr-util to SVN\Subversion\apr-util
  Now open the Apache.dsw file and compile apache.
- Download the openssl source package from
  http://www.openssl.org/source/ and unzip it to SVN\common
  open a dos prompt and go to SVN\common\openssl
  run the file <installdir_of_vs.net>\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat
  > perl Configure VC-WIN32
  > ms\do_masm
  > nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
  don't close the dos-prompt, you'll need it later.
- Download the zlib source from 
  http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ and unzip it to SVN\common\zlib
  Copy the file zlib\win32\Makefile.msc to zlib\
  > nmake /f Makefile.msc
  > copy zlib.lib zlibstat.lib
- Download the newest neon source from 
  http://www.webdav.org/neon/ and unzip it into SVN\Subversion
  then rename the folder neon-0.xx.x to neon.
- in the dos-prompt cd to SVN\Subversion. Then type
  > python gen-make.py -t vcproj --with-openssl=PathTo\Common\openssl --with-zlib=PathTo\Common\zlib
  this will create all the project files for visual studio.
  Open VS.NET and then open the *.sln file. Build the project called __ALL__.
  This will build all other projects in the workspace too.
  Now you have successfully compiled Subversion!
- Checkout the TortoiseSVN sources from the Subversion repository.
  You need a subversion client to do this. Check it out to
  SVN\TortoiseSVN
  Open the solution file and compile.
- To compile the crashrpt project for TortoiseSVN, you'll need the WTL.
  You can get that library from here:
  http://download.microsoft.com/download/VisualStudioNET/Install/7.0/WXP/EN-US/WTL70.exe
  But the crashrpt project is not needed for TortoiseSVN to compile.

CAUTION:
If you have both VS.NET2002 and VS.NET2003 installed (or once had) make sure
you build all libraries with the same version! Always check in the about
box of the IDE which version you're actually using to compile a library
so you don't mix up.
