First, you need to install some utilities/programs:
- Install VS.NET2003
- Install the java runtime. Get it from http://java.sun.com
- Install Python 2.2. You can get it from here:
  http://www.python.org/windows/
- Set the path where you installed python to the PATH environement variable.
- Install Perl. Get it from http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/
- Get the WiX tools from http://wix.sourceforge.net and unzip them. Then add
  it to the PATH environement variable.

You may have to logoff/logon to make the new environement variables take effect!

- create a new folder on your harddisk, e.g. SVN. Make sure you have at least
  1.5 GB of free space left!!!
- Now checkout the subversion source into SVN\Subversion.
  If you're using TortoiseSVN to checkout the sources
  then right-click into the SVN folder and select "checkout".
  In the dialog enter the URL and add "\Subversion" to
  the checkout path.
  Make sure you check out the Subversion source from either the 1.1.x branch or
  one of the 1.1.x tags!
- Download the compiled berkeley db library from
  the TortoiseSVN download area:
  http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=616
  and unzip it to SVN\Subversion\db4-win32
- Download the newest source of the apache server
  for windows from http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi
  Unzip the sources into SVN\Subversion
  Then copy (not move) the folders
  SVN\Subversion\httpd-2.0.xx\srclib\apr to SVN\Subversion\apr
  SVN\Subversion\httpd-2.0.xx\srclib\apr-iconv to SVN\Subversion\apr-iconv
  SVN\Subversion\httpd-2.0.xx\srclib\apr-util to SVN\Subversion\apr-util
- create a new folder in SVN called 'common'
- Download the openssl source package from
  http://www.openssl.org/source/ and unzip it to SVN\common, then rename
  the folder from openssl-0.9.xx to openssl
- Download the zlib source from 
  http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ and unzip it to SVN\common\zlib
- Download the newest neon source from 
  http://www.webdav.org/neon/ and unzip it into SVN\Subversion
  then rename the folder neon-0.xx.x to neon.
- Checkout the TortoiseSVN sources from the Subversion repository into
  SVN\TortoiseSVN
- Download the tools to build the TSVN docs from 
  http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/files/documents/406/11147/tools.zip and
  unzip them into SVN\TortoiseSVN\doc\.
- Make a copy of the file TortoiseVars.tmpl in the TSVN root folder and
  rename that copy to TortoiseVars.bat. Then simply adjust the paths as mentioned
  in that file.
- To compile the crashrpt project for TortoiseSVN, you'll need the WTL.
  You can get that library from here: http://wtl.sourceforge.net/
  Unzip it and then add the path to the VS.NET include path.

Note: Since the Subversion project builder is broken right now, the build script
won't work right now (until that gets fixed). A workaround for that is:
- open a DOS box, cd to the Subversion directory.
- type
python gen-make.py -t vcproj --with-openssl=..\Common\openssl --with-zlib=..\Common\zlib --with-apr=apr --with-apr-util=apr-util --with-apr-iconv=apr-iconv --enable-nls
  to generate the project files
- Open the subversion_vcnet.sln file in VS.NET
- Right click in the solution explorer on the project "libaprutil"
- In the properties dialog, go to Linker/Input and add the string 
  "..\db4-win32\lib\libdb42.lib" to the "Additional Dependencies" (for all builds,
  release and debug).
- Save the new project settings.
- now you can use TSVN build script.

Now, if you got some time left you can run the build.bat script to compile
TortoiseSVN. Grab a cup of coffee - it can take up to two hours, depending on
how fast your computer is (on mine, it takes 1 hour and 50 minutes)!
