A list things we still need or want to do:

TortoiseSVN:
- change the repository browser to use a two pane view (tree and filelist)
  instead of just the tree. This also paves the way to implement functions
  which require a selection of two objects (like viewing a diff between
  two branch and trunk, ...)
- Make double-click on files / revisions always show changes, but don't remove them from the context menu, if they are already there:
  Log Messages, Bottom box: (There is only one action) double-click-file to show changes
  Log Messages, Top box: double-click to show changes of revision as unified diff
  Update Progess: double-click on any file to show changes (new), if conflicted launch conflict editor
  Maybe other Dialogs as well?

TortoiseMerge:
- If the patchfile leaves a file completely empty, ask the user if (s)he
  wants to delete that file (Problem: how to delete it from version control too?)
- Settings dialog.
- Support for CVS diff files
- Comparing folders.
- Handling of different filetypes (encoding). Autodetect? User-selectable?
- Add a splash screen
- Show differences wordwise, not just linewise
- Relocate the resources to a separate dll for better translation
