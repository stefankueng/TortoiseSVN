A list things we still need or want to do:

TortoiseSVN:
- Add a "default" button to the programs-settingspage which will fill in
  the paths and arguments to use TortoiseMerge
- change the repository browser to use a two pane view (tree and filelist)
  instead of just the tree. This also paves the way to implement functions
  which require a selection of two objects (like viewing a diff between
  two branch and trunk, ...)


TortoiseMerge:
- Change the logo in the about-box
- If the patchfile leaves a file completely empty, ask the user if (s)he
  wants to delete that file (Problem: how to delete it from version control too?)
- Test if a patchfile which creates a new file works.
- Show a modeless dialog while a specific version of a file is fetched since
  this could take a while and the user want's to know what's going on.
- Settings dialog.
- Support for CVS diff files
- Comparing folders.
- Handling of different filetypes (encoding). Autodetect? User-selectable?
- Ignoring whitespaces when diffing.
