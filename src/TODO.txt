A list things we still need or want to do:

TortoiseSVN:
- change the repository browser to use a two pane view (tree and filelist)
  instead of just the tree. This also paves the way to implement functions
  which require a selection of two objects (like viewing a diff between
  two branch and trunk, ...)
- Add a "(de)select all" checkbox to the commit dialog.
  "Even better would be a Visual SourceSafe-like interface where you can
  check/uncheck an entire subtree of files with one operation"

TortoiseMerge:
- If the patchfile leaves a file completely empty, ask the user if (s)he
  wants to delete that file (Problem: how to delete it from version control too?)
- Settings dialog.
- Support for CVS diff files
- Comparing folders.
- Handling of different filetypes (encoding). Autodetect? User-selectable?
- Add a splash screen
- Show differences wordwise, not just linewise
- Relocate the resources to a separate dll for better translation
