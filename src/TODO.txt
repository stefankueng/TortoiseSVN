A list of things we still need or want to do:

TortoiseSVN:
- change the repository browser to use a two pane view (tree and filelist)
  instead of just the tree. This also paves the way to implement functions
  which require a selection of two objects (like viewing a diff between
  two branch and trunk, ...)

TortoiseMerge:
- If the patchfile leaves a file completely empty, ask the user if (s)he
  wants to delete that file (Problem: how to delete it from version control too?)
- Support for CVS diff files
- Comparing folders.
- Handling of different filetypes (encoding). Autodetect? User-selectable?
- Add a splash screen ?
