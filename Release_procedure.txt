- about a week or two before a new release, which can be initiated by 
  any dev, we create a branch from /trunk for that release
- the nightly builds switch from /trunk to that branch so that from this
  time on users can test the release candidate
- bugs found and fixed during that time are fixed on /trunk, and 
  mentioned in a Backport.txt file on the branch
- the dev who fixed that bug decides himself if it should be backportet 
  or not, and if yes merges it to the release branch right away
- if another dev then objects to that merge (of course always with an 
  explanation why) that fix get's undone on the branch. I don't think 
  that will happen very often though.

Then, on the release branch:

- Check the latest versions of Apache, openssl, zlib, neon and of course
  download any newer versions available.
- increment the version number in the installer script
- increment the version number in the version.in file
- increment the version number in LanguagePack.nsi
- finish the changelog.txt file, i.e. add the version title
- run the build.bat script

if all goes well (no errors while running the script) install the new
version and test one last time.

while the script runs, move all the old files in the filesharing area
from the binaries folder to the binaries/archive folder.

- zip the files Languages\TortoiseProcLang.dll and 
  Languages\TortoiseMergeLang.dll to Languages_1.1.x.zip and upload that
  to the filesharing area on tigris.org.

Now commit those changes and then create the tag in the repository

- run the build.bat script again

The last steps:
- zip the files Languages\TortoiseProcLang.dll and 
  Languages\TortoiseMergeLang.dll to Languages_1.1.x.zip and replace the
  previously uploaded file with the current one (indicating the new revision
  number after the last commit).
- rename the msi installer files to indicate the correct version number
- upload the msi files to the filesharing area on tigris.org
- edit the web files download.html, index.html, project_status.html to
  indicate the new release
- edit the file version.txt to match the exact version number of the release
- copy the new generated docs to the web docs folder
- commit the web pages
