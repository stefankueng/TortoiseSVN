TSVN releases are generally cut directly from the trunk, unless there is
a particular reason to do otherwise, eg. bugfix-only branch for older OS.

The rationale for this is described in www/release_info.html

- about a week before the release, an announcement is made on the
  mailing list, indicating the expected release date and encouraging
  users to download and test the nightly builds.

- during this period, only 'safe' changes are committed, ie. bugfixes,
  resource and doc updates, and trivial changes.

A major release (one which adds significant new features) is usually
preceded by a few release candidates. These are created in the same
way as the full release, but the requirement for 1 week's stabilisation
may be relaxed. Release candidates are created simply to allow more
widespread testing than can be achieved with the nightly builds.
They are announced in the same way as a full release to encourage
more users to take part in testing.

These steps are required to generate the release:

- Check the latest versions of Apache, openssl, zlib, neon and of course
  download any newer versions available.
- increment the version number in version.in file
- finish the changelog.txt file, i.e. add the version title
- run the build.bat script

if all goes well (no errors while running the script) install the new
version and test one last time.

while the script runs, move all the old files in the filesharing area
from the binaries folder to the binaries/archive folder.

- zip the files Languages\TortoiseProcLang.dll and 
  Languages\TortoiseMergeLang.dll to Languages_1.1.x.zip and upload that
  to the filesharing area on tigris.org.

Now commit those changes and then create the tag in the repository

- run the build.bat script again

The last steps:
- zip the files Languages\TortoiseProcLang.dll and 
  Languages\TortoiseMergeLang.dll to Languages_1.1.x.zip and replace the
  previously uploaded file with the current one (indicating the new revision
  number after the last commit).
- rename the msi installer files to indicate the correct version number
- upload the msi files to the filesharing area on tigris.org
- edit the web files download.html, index.html, project_status.html to
  indicate the new release
- edit the file version.txt to match the exact version number of the release
- copy the new generated docs to the web docs folder
- commit the web pages

Announcements:
- Mail to dev@tortoisesvn.tigris.org, announce@tortoisesvn.tigris.org
- Add a news item on tigris.org
- Remember to include a link to the download page in the announcements.
