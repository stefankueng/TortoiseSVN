Feature Proposal
================

Name
----

Tag Externals


Purpose
-------

Allow fixing externals to the then current HEAD
revision when creating a branch/tag.

Currently, when creating a branch or tag, the externals
are tagged as they are. If those externals point to the
HEAD revision, the branch/tag is not really fixed since
those externals will 'change'.


Functional Details
------------------

The branch/tag dialog will show an option to tag the
external properties. This requieres the working copy
to be scanned for svn:external properties. This scan
is done in a background thread like the status thread
which is used now to find the working copy revision.

Once the thread is finished, the option controls get
enabled if there are svn:external properties found
in the working copy.

There are two possible work flows:

(1) Modify the external properties in the working copy,
    then create the branch/tag from the working copy.
(2) branch/tag from a revision or HEAD in the repository,
    then change the svn:external properties in the
    repository, causing a new revision for each changed
    property.


Target Version
--------------

1.7


Possible Development Stages
---------------------------

(1) Implement a svn:external parser which is able
    to detect whether an external points to HEAD
	or is already fixed. And allow modifying
	the property to set a fixed revision.
(2) Find the HEAD revisions of all found externals
(3) Extend the branch/tag dialog with the new controls
    and a new dialog to select which external to tag.
(4) Extend the SVNProgressDlg to commit the external
    property changes after a successful branch/tag.
