Feature Proposal
================

Name
----

Extensions to Cleanup


Purpose
-------

Allow the user to clean up a working copy beyond
what the functionality currently provides (i.e.
repair only).

These extensions will also be helpful for the
bisection feature.


Functional Details
------------------

A new dialog is introduced for the "cleanup" command. 
Since this is not a frequently used function, the
extra clicks won't impair the user experience. 
This dialog contains the following checkboxes:

[X] Clear up working copy status
[ ] Revert all changes
[ ] Delete ignored files and folders
[ ] Delete other files and folders
[ ] Unversion working copy

[OK] [Cancel]

With the new working copy code in 1.7, the last 
operation may not be feasible. Omit it in that case.

The defaults are as shown above and cannot be changed
(i.e. we shouldn't add a "set as default" button
because these are very destructive operations that
may undo the results of hours of work).

All selected operations are executed one after
another in the same order as listed.


On Implementation 
-----------------

The functionality should be encapsuled in the UI-
independent command object. Otherwise, it would not
be reusable in other contexts.


Target Version
--------------

1.7


Proposed Status at First Release
--------------------------------

Fully supported and documented feature.
