Translations
------------

TortoiseSVN is still in development so
translations of all resources is also
a work 'in progress'.

General
-------
The TortoiseSVN project uses gettext PO (portable object) files for its translation.
PO files are plain text, so you can even translate using a normal text
editor. The only thing you have to take care of is that the editor can handle
the UTF-8 charset. There is a wide range of tools out there that can handle and 
manipulate PO files. 
We recommend that you use poEdit (http://poedit.sourceforge.net) on windows or
kbabel (http://i18n.kde.org/tools/kbabel/) on Linux.

This description assumes that you use poEdit.

Getting started
---------------
If you want to implement a new language for TortoiseSVN do the following.

1) Use TortoiseSVN (or any other SubVersion client) to check out: 
   http://svn.collab.net/repos/tortoisesvn/trunk/src/Languages/
   (You will get more than one file)
   or point your browser to:
   http://svn.collab.net/repos/tortoisesvn/trunk/src/Languages/
   right-click on Tortoise.pot and save this file to your local harddisk.

2) Tortoise.pot is the template (hence .pot) for the translation.
   Rename Tortoise.pot to Tortoise_xx.po, where xx is your two letter ISO 
   country code. If you're not sure about your country code, look here:
   http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html
   The German PO file would be named Tortoise_de.po

3) Now translate what you can using poEdit. If you are not sure with one or
   the other translation, mark it as "fuzzy"
   If you are not sure about the meaning of the original sentence ask on the list.

4) Add a header with '#' comments to the PO file that explains which language 
   you translated and the terminology you used, like:
   #
   # German translations for TortoiseSVN
   # This file is distributed under the same license as the subversion package.
   #
   # Translation dictionary:
   #
   # argument     parameter
   # bogus        ungültig
   # checkout     auschecken (denglisch, ich weiß, aber akzeptabel)
   # client       Client, des Client
   # commit       übertragen
   # item         Objekt
   # label        Marke / Markierung
 
5) Send your Tortoise_xx.po to the mailing list
	 
Adding to an existing translation
---------------------------------
1) Get hold of Tortoise.pot and the Tortoise_xx.po you want to improve

2) Start poEdit with Tortise_xx.po and select "Update from .pot file" from the 
   "Catalog" Menu

3) Select Tortoise.pot and wait until poEdit has finished merging the template
   and the current translation.
   
4) The untranslated strings (and fuzzy translations) are at the top of the list.

5) Translate what you can and send the resulting PO file back to the mailing
   list.

What now?
---------
That's all you have to do. We'll take care of creating the ressource dlls and
installers for the different language packs.
