Translations
------------

TortoiseSVN is still in development so translations of all resources is
also a work 'in progress'.

General
-------
The TortoiseSVN project uses gettext PO (portable object) files for its
translation. PO files are plain text, so you can even translate using a
normal text editor. The only thing you have to take care of is that the
editor can handle the UTF-8 charset. There is a wide range of tools out
there that can handle and manipulate PO files. The preferred way however
is to translate using transifex.com.

Translating using transifex.com
-------------------------------
Visit transifex.com and register an account there. After having done this,
go to the TortoiseSVN translation project and request to join a language
team of your choice.

Transifex has a nice web interface. You can edit everything there, but you
can also download the .po file, work offline using your preferred editor and
upload the .po file to transifex again.

We take care of synchronizing the translations between transifex.com and our
repository.

If you want to start a new language, contact us on https://groups.google.com/g/tortoisesvn-dev

Important
---------
Please pay special attention to cases where placeholders for variables like
"%s" or "%d" appear in the original text. They have to be in the exact
same order in the translation, which means that you sometimes have to
use "bad" grammar  in your language. If you reverse the parameters
it may crash the translated application.

What now?
---------
That's all you have to do. We'll take care of creating the resource dlls
and installers for the different language packs.

Building your own dlls
----------------------
If you want to test the translations you made yourself, before you release
them, you need four things:

- The "raw" language resource dlls for your version of TortoiseSVN. Please ask on
  the developers list. We'll gladly provide you with the necessary files.
- The pot file for your version of TortoiseSVN e.g:
  https://svn.code.sf.net/p/tortoisesvn/code/tags/version_1.0.8/...
- Any po file for your language. Either pick one from tags or the latest
  po file from trunk
- The ResText utility that is used to insert the data from the po file
  into your resource dlls:
  http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/files/documents/406/14560/ResText.zip

Once you finished your installation, you run:

restext apply TortoiseProcLang.dll ..\bin\TortoiseProcNNNN.dll Tortoise_CC.po
restext apply TortoiseMergeLang.dll ..\bin\TortoiseMergeNNNN.dll Tortoise_CC.po

where NNNN is your four digit country code (1031 for germany)
and CC is your 2 letter country code (de for germany)

You can find the four digit country code at
http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/lcid-all.mspx
under the column LCID dec.

After successfully creating your dlls, copy them into:
C:\Program Files\TortoiseSVN\Languages
Now you should be able to select your language from the combobox on the
TortoiseSVN main setting page.
