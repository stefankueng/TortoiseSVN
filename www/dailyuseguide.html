      Introduction
    </h1>
    <p class="column">
      This document describes day to day usage of the TortoiseSVN
      client. It is <em>not</em> an introduction to version
      control systems, and <em>not</em> an introduction to
      Subversion <em>(SVN)</em>. It is more like a place you may
      turn to when you know approximately what you want to do,
      but don't quite remember how to do it.
    </p>
    <p class="column">
      This document is also a work in progress, just as
      TortoiseSVN and Subversion are. If you find any mistakes,
      please report them to the mailing list so we can update the
      daily use guide.
    </p>
    <p class="column">
      It is assumed that you already have installed TortoiseSVN.
    </p>
    <p class="column">
      If you're not familiar with Subversion the you should read
      "<a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com">Subversion: The

      Terminology
    </h1>
    <p class="column">
      The terminology used in the SVN documentation, and thus
      also in TortoiseSVN, may differ from terminology used in
      other source repository systems. In an attempt to avoid
      confusion, we provide a short list of the most essential
      terms. Please make yourself familiar with these words
      before diving into the rest of this document.

      Creating A Local Repository
    </h1>
    <p>
      If you don't want to create a local repository and use a
      server based repository instead then you may skip this
      chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can create a local repository with TortoiseSVN very
      easily:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open the windows explorer
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a new folder and name it "SVNRepository" for
        example
      </li>
      <li>
        Right-click on the folder. Select "Create repository
        here" from the TortoiseSVN submenu. Now the repository is
        created at that location. Don't edit those files
        yourself! If you get any errors please make sure that the
        folder is not write protected and empty!
      </li>
    </ol>
    <img alt="First Steps" src="images/Menu1.jpg"> 
    <p>
      To access your local repository you need the path to that
      folder. Just remember that Subversion expects all
      repository paths in the form:
      <em>"file:///SVNRepository/"</em>. For Windows users:
      <em>"file:///C:/SVNRepository/"</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you run into trouble accessing a local repository on a
      network drive, please check the <a href=
      "http://subversion.tigris.org/project_faq.html">Subversion
      FAQ</a>.
    </p>
    <h1>
      Importing A Project To A New Repository
    </h1>
    <p>
      Before you import your project into a repository you
      should:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Remove all files which are not needed to build the
        project (temporary files, files which are generated by a
        compiler e.g. *.obj, compiled binaries, ...)
      </li>
      <li>
        Organize the files in folders and subfolders. Although it
        is possible to rename/move files later it is highly
        recommended to do that before importing!
      </li>
      <li>
        The recommended directory structure is as follows:<br>
         
<pre>
C:/import/trunk/ProjectName
C:/import/branches/
C:/import/tags/
</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        That way you can easily create branches and tags later.
        Please note that this is only a recommendation. You can
        of course use any other directory structure you want but
        it might get difficult to organize branches and tags. If
        you choose this directory layout then TortoiseSVN will
        warn you if you try to commit to a path in the /tags/
        folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now select the parent <i>import</i> folder of your
      directory structure in the windows explorer and right click
      to bring up the context menu. Select the command
      "Import..." which brings up a dialog box:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="Import Dialog" src="images/import.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
      In this dialog you have to enter the URL of the repository
      into which you want to import your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      By checking <em>Use foldername as modulename</em>, the name
      of the directory you selected to bring up the context menu
      is used as the SVN modulename.<br>
       We recommend to leave this option unchecked for your
      initial import and check it if you add projects later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The import message is used as a log message. Since you
      usually just started your project a default "initial
      import" is filled in by TortoiseSVN.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as you press the OK button TortoiseSVN imports the
      complete directory tree including all files into the
      repository. Please note that this does <b>NOT</b> put your
      copy of the project under version control yet. To get a
      versioned working copy you need to <em>Checkout</em> the
      version you just imported!
    </p>
    <p>
      The repository structure you just created now looks like
      this:
    </p>
<pre>
C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/All
C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/your
C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/files
C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/are
C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/here
C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/...
C:/SVNRepository/branches/
C:/SVNRepository/tags/
</pre>
    <p>
      If you would have checked <em>Use foldername as
      modulename</em> it would have looked like this:
    </p>
<pre>
C:/SVNRepository/import/trunk/ProjectName/...
C:/SVNRepository/import/branches/
C:/SVNRepository/import/tags/
</pre>
    <p>
      If you later want to import C:/myFiles/AnotherProject,
      select <em>C:/SVNRepository/trunk/</em> as URL of
      repository and check <em>Use foldername as modulename</em>.
      This project is then imported into the following structure
    </p>
<pre>
C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/...
C:/SVNRepository/trunk/AnotherProject/...
C:/SVNRepository/branches/
C:/SVNRepository/tags/
</pre>
    <h1>
      Checking Out A Working Copy
    </h1>
    <p>
      To obtain a working copy you need to <em>checkout</em> it
      from a repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select a directory in windows explorer where you want to
      place your working copy. Right-click to bring up the
      context menu and select the command "Checkout..." which
      brings up a dialog box:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="Checkout Dialog" src="images/Checkout.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
      If you enter a folder name that does not yet exist, then a
      directory with that name is created.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is recommended that you check out only the "trunk" part
      of the directory tree. If you specify the parent path of
      the directory tree in the URL then you might end up with a
      full harddisk since you will get a copy of each branch and
      also each tag of your project!
    </p>
    <h1>
      Icon Overlays
    </h1>
    <p>
      Now that you have checked out a working copy from a
      Subversion repository you can see your files in the windows
      explorer with changed icons. TortoiseSVN adds to each file
      icon a so called "overlay icon" which overlaps the original
      file icon. Depending on the Subversion status of the file
      the overlay icon is different. A fresh checked out working
      copy has a green checkmark as overlay. that means the
      Subversion status is "normal". As soon as you start editing
      a file, the status changes to "modified" and the icon
      overlay then changes to a red exclamation mark. That way
      you can easily see which files were changed since you last
      updated your working copy and need to be commited. If
      during an update a "conflict" occurs then the icon changes
      to a yellow exclamation mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The folder icons also have icon overlays displayed. By
      default, only the status of the folder itself is shown. But
      you can change that behaviour in the settings (context
      menu, Settings...) so that the status of folders is shown
      recursively. This will make the icon overlays for folders
      slower and is therefore not recommended on slower machines.
      I'm using that setting on my machine (PIII, 700MHz, 512MB
      RAM) without problems. With this setting each folder shows
      the status of all files below it, where status "conflict"
      overrides "modified" and "modified" overrides "normal". So
      you can easily see if there's a file with a conflict or a
      modified file in a folder.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="Icon Overlays" src="images/image3.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike TortoiseCVS (the CVS shell integration) no overlay
      icon for unversioned files is shown.
    </p>
    <h1>
      Update Your Working Copy With Changes From Others
    </h1>
    <p>
      Occasionally you may want changes done by others to get
      incorporated in your local working copy. The process of
      getting changes from the server to your local copy is known
      as <em>updating</em>. Updating may be done on single files,
      a set of selected files, or recursively on entire directory
      hierarchies. To update, select the files and/or directories
      you want, right click and select "Update" in the
      TortoiseSVN submenu. A window will pop up displaying the
      progress of the update as it runs.
    </p>
    <p>
       <img alt="Update Progress" src="images/image10.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="Update Progress finished" src=
      "images/image12.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
      Changes done by others will be merged into your files,
      keeping any changes you may have done to the same files.
      The repository is <em>not</em> affected by an update.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you receive reports of conflicts during the update,
      please read the "resolving conflicts" section.
    </p>
    <h1>
      Sending Your Changes To The Repository
    </h1>
    <p>
      Sending the changes you made to your working copy is known
      as <em>committing</em> the changes. But before you commit
      your changes you really should do an <em>update</em> first.
      See the previous chapter on how to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as you updated your working copy and resolved
      possible conflicts you are ready to commit your changes.
      Select any file and/or folders you want to commit and
      select "Commit" in the context menu. A Dialog appears
      displaying the progress of the commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="Commit Progress" src="images/image11.jpg">
    </p>
    <h1>
      Resolving Conflicts
    </h1>
    <p class="column">
      Once in a while, you will get a <em>conflict</em> when you
      update your files from the repository. A conflict occurs
      when two or more developers have changed the same few lines
      of a file. As Subversion knows nothing of your project, it
      leaves resolving the conflicts to the developers. Whenever
      a conflict is reported, you should open the file in
      question, and search for lines starting with the string
      <tt>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</tt>. The conflicting area
      is marked like this:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <em>filename</em><br>
             <em>your changes</em><br>
         =======<br>
             <em>code merged from repository</em><br>
         &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <em>revision</em><br>
        </code>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="column">
      Also, for every conflicted file Subversion places three
      additional files in your directory:
    </p>
    <div class="variablelist">
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <span class="term"><tt>filename.*.mine</tt></span>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            This is your file as it existed in your working copy
            before you updated your working copy&mdash;that is,
            without conflict markers. This file has your latest
            changes in it and nothing else.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <span class="term"><tt>filename.*.rOLDREV</tt></span>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            This is the file that was the BASE revision before
            you updated your working copy. That is, it the file
            that you checked out before you made your latest
            edits.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <span class="term"><tt>filename.*.rNEWREV</tt></span>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            This is the file that your Subversion client just
            received from the server when you updated your
            working copy. This file corresponds to the HEAD
            revision of the repository.
          </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </div>
    <p>
      Here <tt>*</tt> represents some random digits that
      Subversion chooses, <tt>OLDREV</tt> is the revision number
      of the file in your <tt>.svn</tt> directory, and
      <tt>NEWREV</tt> is the revision number of the repository
      HEAD.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should decide what the code should look like, do the
      necessary changes, execute the command "Resolve" in the
      context menu, and commit your modifications to the
      repository. If you don't resolve conflicts Subversion won't
      allow you to commit your changes.
    </p>
    <h1>
      Adding New Files And Directories
    </h1>
    <p>
      If you created new files and/or directories during your
      development process the you need to add them to source
      control also. Select the file(s) and/or directory and
      select the command "Add" from the context menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you added the files/directories to source control the
      file appears with a "modified" icon overlay which means you
      first have to commit your working copy to make those
      files/directories available to other developers. Adding a
      file/directory does <em>not</em> affect the repository!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you add a directory then TortoiseSVN automatically adds
      all files in this directory recursively. So be carefull
      with that command and make sure you don't have any tempory
      or compiler generated files in that directory!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to add files to your working copy which are
      currently located outside of that working copy you can
      select those files and right-drag those files to your
      working copy. As soon as you release the right mouse button
      a popup menu appears where you can select "add files to
      Subversion". The files will then be copied to the working
      copy and added to version control.
    </p>
    <h1>
      Deleting, Renaming And Moving Files
    </h1>
    <p>
      Subversion allows unlike CVS the renaming and moving of
      files. So there are menu entries for that in the
      TortoiseSVN submenu.
    </p>
    <p>
      For moving files inside a working copy you can either use
      the command in the TortoiseSVN submenu or use the drag and
      drop handler:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        select the files you want to move
      </li>
      <li>
        right drag them to the new location inside the working
        copy
      </li>
      <li>
        release the right mouse button
      </li>
      <li>
        in the popup menu select "move files in Subversion to
        here"
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>
      Get/Set Information About Files/Directories
    </h1>
    <p>
      Sometimes you want to have a more detailed information
      about a file/directory than just the icon overlay. You can
      get all the information Subversion provides in the explorer
      properties dialog. Just select the file or directory and
      select "properties" in the context menu (note: this is the
      normal properties menu entry the explorer provides,
      <em>not</em> in the TortoiseSVN submenu!). In the
      properties dialog box TortoiseSVN has added a new property
      page for files under Subversion control.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="Properties" src="images/image15.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Subversion page you can see all relevant information
      about the selected file/directory. Also, you can read and
      set the subversion properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      To show the log entries for the selected item simply press
      "Show Log..." which brings up the log dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="Log Dialog" src="images/image16.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
      To view a specific log message select the corresponding
      entry in the list. If you want to view the changes between
      your working copy and a specific revision use the context
      menu in the list. This command receives the specific
      revision of that file and starts an external diff program
      to show you the differences. By default TortoiseSVN looks
      for a copy of WinDiff (which comes with the Windows SDK),
      but you can set any graphical diff program you want in the
      TortoiseSVN settings.

      Cancelling Changes
    </h1>
    <p>
      If you want to cancel all changes you made in a file since
      the last update you need to select the file, right-click to
      bring up the context menu and then select the command
      "Revert" in the TortoiseSVN submenu. But be sure that you
      really want to do that because all your changes will be
      lost!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is also the way if you want to get a deleted file
      back.
    </p>
    <h1>
      Tagging
    </h1>
    <p>
      Subversion does not know a special command for tagging like
      e.g. CVS. If you need to mark a particular revision (e.g. a
      release version) you can either do nothing and keep a list
      of which revision number corresponds to which name or you
      can use Subversions <em>cheap copies</em>. Cheap copies are
      something similar to links which means that no actual copy
      is made but just a link to a specific file/revision.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have imported your project with the recommended
      directory structure you would do a tag like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      Select the parent folder of your working copy and select
      the command "Branch/Tag..." in the context menu. In the
      dialog then enter the URL to the directory part for the
      tags, i.e. instead of /trunk/ now use /tags/tagname where
      tagname would be e.g. "release_v1.1".
    </p>

    <h1>
      Branching
    </h1>
    <p>
      One of the features of version control systems, is the
      ability to isolate changes onto a separate line of
      development. This line is known as a <em>branch</em>.
      Branches are usually used to try out new features without
      disturbing the main branch of development with compiler
      errors and bugs. As soon as the new feature of the branch
      is stable enough then the branch is <em>merged</em> back
      into the main branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a branch with TortoiseSVN select the parent
      folder and select "Branch/Tag..." in the TortoiseSVN
      submenu. Since both branches and tags are handled
      identically in Subversion (they're simply cheap copies) the
      dialog is the same as for tagging.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="Branch Dialog" src="images/image19.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, instead of making a copy in the tags folder make
      one inside the /branches/ folder. The only difference to
      tags is that you must not change tags afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you have a separate copy of the development source tree
      in the repository (but it doesn't use the same amount of
      disk space - it's a 'cheap copy') on which you can work
      independently from the main branch. But the new branch is
      only in the repository for now. To work on the branch you
      have first to switch your working copy to the newly created
      branch. Again select the parent folder of your project and
      select the command "Switch..." from the context menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="Switch Dialog" src="images/image20.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
      here you enter the URL of the branch you just created.
      Leave the checkbox "newest revision" active. Press ok and
      your working copy represents now the new branch. If you now
      make changes in your working copy and commit them then all
      changes go to the new branch and not the main branch.
    </p>
    <h1>
      Merging A Branch Back Into The Main Branch
    </h1>
    <p>
      When you are satisfied with the changes you have done on a
      branch, you may want those changes to be available on the
      main line of development. Incorporating changes from one
      branch to another, is known as <em>merging</em>. To do the
      merge you need to select the parent folder of your project
      and then select the command "Merge..." in the TortoiseSVN
      submenu.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="Merge Dialog" src="images/image22.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter the URL of the main branch and press OK. While
      merging, there may occur one or more conflicts. See the
      chapter "Resolving Conflicts" on how to do this. Once you
      have resolved all conflicts you can commit the merged files
      to the main branch.
