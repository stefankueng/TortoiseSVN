<p>This document describes day to day usage of the TortoiseSVN
client. It is <em>not</em> an introduction to version control
systems, and <em>not</em> an introduction to Subversion
<b>(SVN)</b>. It is more like a place you may turn to when you
know approximately what you want to do, but don't quite remember
how to do it.</p>
<p>This document is also a work in progress, just as TortoiseSVN
and Subversion are. If you find any mistakes, please report them
to the mailing list so we can update the daily use guide.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is assumed that you already have installed
TortoiseSVN.</li>
<li>If you're not familiar with Subversion the you should read
Subversion: <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">The Definitive
Guide</a> first.</li>

<p>The terminology used in the SVN documentation, and thus also
in TortoiseSVN, may differ from terminology used in other source
repository systems. In an attempt to avoid confusion, we provide
a short list of the most essential terms. Please make yourself
familiar with these words before diving into the rest of this
document.</p>
<dl>
<dt><i>Checkout</i></dt>
<dd>Normally used to describe the first retrieval of an entire
module from the repository.</dd>
<dt><i>Commit</i></dt>
<dd>Sending your modifications to the repository.</dd>
<dt><i>Export</i></dt>
<dd>Refers to extraction of an entire module from the repository,
without any CVS administrative files: Exported modules will not
be under SVN control.</dd>
<dt><i>Import</i></dt>
<dd>Normally refers to the process of creating a new module in
the repository by sending the entire directory structure.</dd>
<dt><i>Module</i></dt>
<dd>A directory hierarchy. A software project normally exists as
a single module in the repository.</dd>
<dt><i>Working Copy</i></dt>
<dd>Your copy of the project on your local harddisk. This is the
copy you are working on.</dd>
<dt><i>Release</i></dt>
<dd>The version of an entire product.</dd>
<dt><i>Repository</i></dt>
<dd>The big black box in which your valuable data resides, to be
automagically retrieved by co-workers anywhere on the planet.<br>
 Subversion repositories can be accessed in three ways: 
<ul>
<li>file:// Anywhere in your local / network filesystem.</li>
<li>http:// Using Apache 2's WEB_DAV protocol.</li>
<li>svn:// Using a standalone SVN server with a special
protocol.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><i>Revision</i></dt>
<dd>The version of a complete repository (including branches and

<p>If you don't want to create a local repository and use a
server based repository instead then you may skip this
chapter.</p>
<p>You can easily create a local repository with TortoiseSVN:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the windows explorer</li>
<li>Create a new folder and name it <b>SVNRepository</b> for
example</li>
<li>Right-click on the folder. Select <b>Create repository
here</b> from the TortoiseSVN submenu. Now the repository is
created at that location. Don't edit those files yourself! If you
get any errors please make sure that the folder is not write
protected and empty!</li>
</ol>
<p class="center"><img alt="First Steps" src=
"images/Menu1.jpg"></p>
<p>To access your local repository you need the path to that
folder. Just remember that Subversion expects all repository
paths in the form: <em>file:///SVNRepository/</em>. For Windows
users: <em>file:///C:/SVNRepository/</em>.</p>
<p>If you run into trouble accessing a local repository on a
network drive, please check the <a href=
"http://subversion.tigris.org/project_faq.html">Subversion
FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>Before you import your project into a repository you
should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove all files which are not needed to build the project
(temporary files, files which are generated by a compiler e.g.
*.obj, compiled binaries, ...)</li>
<li>Organize the files in folders and subfolders. Although it is
possible to rename/move files later it is highly recommended to
do that before importing!</li>
<li>The recommended directory structure is as follows:<br>
 
<pre>
C:/import/trunk/ProjectName
C:/import/branches/
C:/import/tags/
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That way you can easily create branches and tags later. Please
note that this is only a recommendation. You can of course use
any other directory structure you want but it might get difficult
to organize branches and tags. If you choose this directory
layout then TortoiseSVN will warn you if you try to commit to a
path in the /tags/ folder.</p>
<p>Now select the parent <b>import</b> folder of your directory
structure in the windows explorer and right click to open the
context menu. Select the command <b>Import...</b> which brings up
a dialog box:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="Import Dialog" src=
"images/import.jpg"></p>
<p>In this dialog you have to enter the URL of the repository
into which you want to import your project.</p>
<p>By checking <b>Use foldername as modulename</b>, the name of
the directory you selected to open the context menu is used
as the SVN modulename. We recommend to leave this option
unchecked for your initial import and check it if you add
projects later on.</p>
<p>The import message is used as a log message. Since you usually
just started your project a default "initial import" is filled in
by TortoiseSVN.</p>
<p>As soon as you press the OK button TortoiseSVN imports the
complete directory tree including all files into the repository.
Please note that this does <em>NOT</em> put your copy of the
project under version control yet. To get a versioned working
copy you need to do a <em>Checkout</em> of the version you just
imported!</p>
<p>The repository structure you just created now looks like
this:</p>
<pre>
    C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/All
    C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/your
    C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/files
    C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/are
    C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/here
    C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/...
    C:/SVNRepository/branches/
    C:/SVNRepository/tags/
</pre>
<p>If you would have checked <b>Use foldername as modulename</b>
it would have looked like this:</p>
<pre>
    C:/SVNRepository/import/trunk/ProjectName/...
    C:/SVNRepository/import/branches/
    C:/SVNRepository/import/tags/
</pre>
<p>If you later want to import C:/myFiles/AnotherProject, select
<b>C:/SVNRepository/trunk/</b> as <em>URL of repository</em> and
check <b>Use foldername as modulename</b>. This project is then
imported into the following structure:</p>
<pre>
    C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/...
    C:/SVNRepository/trunk/AnotherProject/...
    C:/SVNRepository/branches/
    C:/SVNRepository/tags/

<p>Now that you have checked out a working copy from a Subversion
repository you can see your files in the windows explorer with
changed icons. TortoiseSVN adds a so called <em>overlay icon</em> to
each file icon which overlaps the original file icon. Depending
on the Subversion status of the file the overlay icon is
different. A fresh checked out working copy has a green checkmark
as overlay. that means the Subversion status is <em>normal</em>. As soon
as you start editing a file, the status changes to <em>modified</em> and
the icon overlay then changes to a red exclamation mark. That way
you can easily see which files were changed since you last
updated your working copy and need to be commited. If during an
update a <em>conflict</em> occurs then the icon changes to a yellow
exclamation mark.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="Icon Overlays" src=
"images/Overlays.jpg"></p>
<p>The folder icons also have icon overlays displayed. By
default, only the status of the folder itself is shown. But you
can change that behaviour in the settings (context menu,
Settings...) so that the status of folders is shown recursively.
This will make the icon overlays for folders slower and is
therefore not recommended on slower machines. I'm using that
setting on my machine (PIII, 700MHz, 512MB RAM) without problems.
With this setting each folder shows the status of all files below
it, where status <em>conflict</em> overrides <em>modified</em> and <em>modified</em>
overrides <em>normal</em>. So you can easily see if there's a file with
a conflict or a modified file in a folder.</p>
<p>Unlike TortoiseCVS (the CVS shell integration) no overlay icon
for unversioned files is shown.</p>

<p>Occasionally you may want changes done by others to get
incorporated in your local working copy. The process of getting
changes from the server to your local copy is known as
<em>updating</em>. Updating may be done on single files, a set of
selected files, or recursively on entire directory hierarchies.
To update, select the files and/or directories you want, right
click and select <b>Update</b> in the TortoiseSVN submenu. A window
will pop up displaying the progress of the update as it runs.</p>

<p>Once in a while, you will get a <em>conflict</em> when you
update your files from the repository. A conflict occurs when two
or more developers have changed the same few lines of a file. As
Subversion knows nothing of your project, it leaves resolving the
conflicts to the developers. Whenever a conflict is reported, you
should open the file in question, and search for lines starting
with the string <tt>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</tt>. The
conflicting area is marked like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <em>filename</em><br>
     <em>your changes</em><br>
 =======<br>
     <em>code merged from repository</em><br>
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <em>revision</em><br>
</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, for every conflicted file Subversion places three
additional files in your directory:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl>
<dt><code>filename.*.mine</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is your file as it existed in your working copy before
you updated your working copy&mdash;that is, without conflict
markers. This file has your latest changes in it and nothing
else.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>filename.*.rOLDREV</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the file that was the BASE revision before you updated
your working copy. That is, it the file that you checked out
before you made your latest edits.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>filename.*.rNEWREV</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the file that your Subversion client just received
from the server when you updated your working copy. This file
corresponds to the HEAD revision of the repository.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Here <code>*</code> represents some random digits that Subversion
chooses, <code>OLDREV</code> is the revision number of the file in
your <code>.svn</code> directory, and <code>NEWREV</code> is the revision
number of the repository HEAD.</p>
<p>You should decide what the code should look like, do the
necessary changes, execute the command "Resolve" in the context
menu, and commit your modifications to the repository. If you
don't resolve conflicts Subversion won't allow you to commit your
changes.</p>

submenu!). In the properties dialog box TortoiseSVN has added a
new property page for files under Subversion control.</p>

<p>In the Subversion page you can see all relevant information

This command receives the specific revision of that file and
starts an external diff program to show you the differences. By
default TortoiseSVN looks for a copy of WinDiff (which comes with
the Windows SDK), but you can set any graphical diff program you
want in the TortoiseSVN settings.</p>

development with compiler errors and bugs. As soon as the new
feature of the branch is stable enough then the branch is
<em>merged</em> back into the main branch.</p>
<p>Another feature of version control systems is the ability to
mark particular revisions (e.g. a release version), so you can at
any time recreate a certain build or environment. This proces is
known as <em>tagging</em>.</p>
<p>Subversion does not know a special command for branching or
tagging. There is a system called <em>cheap copies</em> instead.
Cheap copies are something similar to links, which means that no
actual copy is made but just a link to a specific file/revision
is created.</p>
<p>If you have imported your project with the recommended
directory structure creating a branch or tag version is very
simple:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="Branch / Tag / Copy" src=
"images/Copy.jpg"></p>
<p>Select the parent folder of your working copy and select the
command "Branch/Tag..." from the context menu. Enter the URL to
the repository path for branches or tags into the dialog. So
instead of /trunk/ you would now use /tags/tagname where tagname
would be e.g. "ProjectName_v1.10".</p>
<pre>
    C:/SVNRepository/trunk/ProjectName/...
    C:/SVNRepository/trunk/AnotherProject/...
    C:/SVNRepository/branches/ProjectName_SpecialDebugBuildBasedOn_v1.09/
    C:/SVNRepository/tags/ProjectName_v1.10
</pre>
<p>If you press OK now, Subversion just creates a cheap copy of
your selected Directory <em>inside the repository</em>. Nothing
has happened to your local Disk (yet). To be able to work with
your freshly generated copy you have several ways to handle it.
You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>do a <em>Checkout</em> of it again. You can check it out to
any location on your local disk and you can create as many
working copies from your repository as you like.</li>
<li><em>Switch</em> your current working copy to the newly
created branch. Again select the parent folder of your project
and select the command "Switch..." from the context menu.</li>
</ul>
<p class="center"><img alt="Switch Dialog" src=
"images/image20.jpg"></p>
<p>here you enter the URL of the branch /tag you just created.
Leave the checkbox "newest revision" active. Press ok and your
working copy is switched to the new branch / tag.</p>
<p>From now on working with branches or tags differs a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you modify a Tag revision, TortoiseSVN will warn you if
you try to commit to a /tags path in the repository. Be aware,
that your local files are not write protected. So working on a
tag revision is not-a-good-idea(tm). That's the reason why we
recommend the /trunk /branches /tags repository structure in the
first place.</li>
<li>If you modify a working copy created from a branch and
commit, then all changes go to the new branch and not the main
branch. Only the modifications are stored. The rest remains a
<em>cheap copy</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are satisfied with the changes you have done on a
branch, you may want those changes to be available on the main
line of development. Incorporating changes from one branch to
another, is known as <em>merging</em>. To do the merge you need
to select the parent folder of your project and then select the
command "Merge..." in the TortoiseSVN submenu.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="Merge Dialog" src=
"images/image22.jpg"></p>
<p>Enter the URL of the main branch and press OK. While merging,
one or more conflicts may occur . See the chapter "Resolving
Conflicts" on how to do this. Once you have resolved all
conflicts you can commit the merged files to the main branch.</p>
