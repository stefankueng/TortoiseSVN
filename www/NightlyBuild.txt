Installing the Nightly Build
----------------------------

The nightly build site now contains several builds.

The 'Latest/' folder contains files which are built daily from the HEAD
revision of TSVN trunk code, which is useful for testing the latest changes.
These are not official released files, so any new features may not have
been extensively tested.

As of version 1.4.x we support both win32 and x64 versions of Windows.
Be sure to select the correct one for your operating system.

All interaction with the repository is handled by subversion itself,
and usually only official subversion releases, or release candidates are used.
This greatly reduces your risk exposure when using this Beta code. However,
we do sometimes build from Subversion trunk just before a major release,
so check on the mailing list if this is a concern.

We also have a stable branch, eg. 1.3.x which contains the latest release
plus any recent bugfixes. This build is not updated very often,
only when the developers have added some bugfixes which need testing
before a new bugfix release.

To install the latest version, you need to download the .msi file,
and use the Windows Installer to load it. Normally you can just
double-click on the file after you have downloaded it.

When installation is complete, reboot your PC, as recommended by the installer.
This ensures that all updated files get copied to their final destination.
If you are feeling lucky you can just log off and log on, but you will need
to check the version of TortoiseSVN.dll to make sure it has been updated.

You can check the revision number of the nightly build by looking at
Updates.txt which shows the repository revision that was used for the build.

The update and build starts at 2300GMT and the upload starts as soon as
the build is complete, so should normally be completed by 0000GMT.
The mapcar.org server shows timestamps in Eastern time (US and Canada),
ie. GMT -0500.
