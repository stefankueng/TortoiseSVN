                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.7 is a superset of all previous TortoiseSVN releases,
                and is considered the current stable and "best" release. Anything in earlier versions
                is also in 1.7, but 1.7 contains features and
                bugfixes not present in any earlier release.</p>
                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.7 dropped support for Windows 2000. It requires
                at least Windows XP with service pack 3 to work. If you're still
                using Windows 2000 or Windows XP without service pack 3, you
                either have to upgrade your OS or keep using TortoiseSVN 1.6.</p>

                <p>This page describes only major changes. For a complete list
                of changes, you can check our

                <h2>working copy metadata storage improvements</h2>

                <p>Subversion 1.7 features a complete re-write of the working copy
                metadata management system of Subversion, code named <strong>WC-NG</strong>.
                You can find out more about this new format in the
                <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.7.html#wc-ng">
                Subversion 1.7 release notes</a>.</p>

                <div class="h4" id="single-db">
                <h4>Centralized Metadata Storage</h4>

                <p>A key feature of the changes introduced in Subversion 1.7 is the
                centralization of working copy metadata storage into a single location.
                Instead of a <code>.svn</code> directory in every directory in the working
                copy, Subversion 1.7 working copies have just one <code>.svn</code>
                directory&mdash;in the root of the working copy.  This directory includes
                (among other things) an SQLite-backed database which contains all of the
                metadata Subversion needs for that working copy.</p>

                <p>Even though the data is stored in a structured format, the relationships
                between the data are complex.  We highly discourage external tools from
                modifying the data held in this database, as such modification is likely to
                result in working copy corruption.</p>
                </div>  <!-- single-db -->

                <div class="h4" id="wc-upgrade">
                <h4>Upgrading the Working Copy</h4>

                <p>Subversion 1.7 introduces substantial changes to the working copy format.
                In previous releases, Subversion would automatically update
                the working copy to the new format when a write operation was performed.
                Subversion 1.7, however, will make this a manual step.</p>
                <p>Before you can use an existing working copy with TortoiseSVN 1.7, you
                have to upgrade the format first. If you right-click on an old
                working copy, TortoiseSVN only shows you one command in the
                context menu: <code>Upgrade working copy</code>.</p>
                <img src="img/upgradewc.png" alt="upgradewc" width="300" height="54"/>
                <div class="tip">
                <p>
                To be on the safe side, you should run a <code>cleanup</code>
                with your pre-1.7 svn client on all your working copies, because
                if the working copy is in an inconsistent state the upgrade
                process might fail. Best to run cleanup before installing the new
                version of TortoiseSVN.
                </p>
                <p>
                Even after cleanup the upgrade process does not always run as
                smoothly as it should, and it can be quite slow. We recommend that
                you commit all changes to your working copy (using your pre-1.7 client)
                before upgrading. If the upgrade fails for any reason, just make
                a fresh checkout.
                </p>
                </div>
                <div class="caution">
                <p>
                Once you've upgraded your working copies, older SVN clients
                won't be able to access those working copies. So make sure
                that you update all your SVN clients (in case you use not
                just TortoiseSVN).
                </p>
                <p>
                For your convenience TortoiseSVN includes a copy of the 1.7 SVN
                command line client in the <code>TortoiseSVN/bin</code> directory.

                <h2>x64 Installer</h2>
                <p>In previous releases, users who installed TortoiseSVN on an
                x64 OS also had to separately install the 32-bit version of
                TortoiseSVN to get its features for 32-bit applications too.</p>
                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.7 includes the required 32-bit parts in its
                x64 installers. There's no need to install the 32-bit version
                of TortoiseSVN on x64 OS.</p>

                <h2>Property dialogs</h2>
                <p>Handling SVN properties is now much easier. Most of the
                properties you want or need to set on your working copies
                can now be set and modified without knowing the exact format.
                TortoiseSVN 1.7 provides custom dialogs for most of the known
                properties.</p>
                <a href="img/propertydlgexternals.png" class="fancybox" rel="gallery" title="propertydlgexternals">

                <p>The above screenshots show the new property dialogs for
                the <code>svn:externals</code> and all the <code>bugtraq:</code>
                properties. There are more custom property dialogs available
                in TortoiseSVN 1.7. Please have a look at the
                <a href="docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-propertypage.html#tsvn-dug-propertypage-editors">docs</a>
                to find out about all of them.</p>

            <div class="post" id="win7libs">
                <h2>Windows 7 Library</h2>
                <p>The explorer in Windows 7 introduced libraries, which are
                containers for files and folders that have something in common.</p>
                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.7 creates a new library type for SVN working
                copies.</p>
                <img src="img/win7svnlib.png" alt="win7svnlib" width="588" height="298"/>
                <p>If you put the root folder of your working copies in that new
                library folder, you get four buttons at the top of the explorer
                which execute the most used commands: Commit, Update, Check for
                modifications and Show log.</p>
                <p>This saves you from using the right-click context menu for
                these often used commands and really saves a lot of mouse clicks.</p>

            <div class="post" id="logdlg">
                <h2>Log dialog</h2>
                <p>The log dialog doesn't look much different. But in its core
                it gained a lot of changes. Most noticable may be the increase
                in performance. Showing and filtering hundred thousand entries
                is now done almost instantly.</p>
                <p>Filtering also has improved a lot. Especially the syntax now
                resembles more what users are used to from web search engines.
                For example, filtering for <code>Alice Bob -Eve</code> will
                show strings containing both Alice and Bob but not Eve. For more
                detailed examples, please refer to the
                <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/nightly/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-showlog.html#tsvn-dug-showlog-filter">docs</a>.</p>
                <p>Another feature the log dialog has is that it highlights
                filter matches in red. That way it's much easier to find out
                which part of a log entry matched the filter string.</p>

                </a>
                <p>If revisions are mentioned in a log message, then the log
                dialog turns those into links. Clicking on those links will
                automatically select the mentioned revision in the log dialog.</p>

            <div class="post" id="revgraph">
                <h2>Revision graph</h2>
                <p>The revision graph also got a lot of improvements. Escpecially
                the startup time has been reduced a lot, which will be most
                noticable for very big repositories.</p>
                <p>Since revision graphs can get very big, saving them as bitmap
                images can lead to very big images. While it was possible to
                save the graph as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Metafile">wmf file</a>,
                that format can only be used on Windows. And of course, you can't
                show it in a web browser.</p>
                <p>The revision graph in version 1.7 can save the graph in
                the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg">svg format</a>.
                Most web browsers can show that format natively, and even Internet
                Explorer in its latest version is able to show those files directly.</p>
                <p>If your browser supports this format, you can have a look
                at the TortoiseSVN revision graph following <a href="img/tsvn.svg">this link</a>.</p>

            <div class="post" id="branchtag">
                <h2>Branch/Tag dialog</h2>
                <p>When creating a branch or tag, the <code>svn:externals</code>
                properties are branched/tagged as they are, usually pointing
                to the HEAD revision of another repository or even the same
                repository but different path.</p>
                <p>If the <code>svn:externals</code> are not <em>tagged</em> too,
                a later checkout from the created tag would fetch the HEAD
                revision of the external, which can lead to inconsistent builds
                if the external got additional commits.</p>
                <p>The branch/tag dialog now allows you to <em>tag</em> the
                externals too.</p>
                <a href="img/branchtagexternals.png" class="fancybox" rel="gallery" title="branchtagexternals">
                    <img src="img/branchtagexternals-small.png" alt="branchtagexternals" width="309" height="317"/>
                </a>
                <p>If externals are set to an explicit revision when creating
                a branch or tag, TortoiseSVN automatically changes the
                <code>svn:externals</code> property. When the branch/tag is
                created from HEAD or a specific revision in the repository,
                TortoiseSVN first creates the branch/tag, then adjusts the
                properties. This will create additional commits for each
                property. When the branch/tag is created from the working copy,
                the properties are modified first, then the branch/tag is
                created and then the properties are changed back to their
                original value.</p>

            <div class="post" id="commitdlg">
                <h2>Commit dialog</h2>
                <p>The commit dialog got a few UI changes as well. The first
                thing you'll notice are the new link labels just above the
                list with the items to commit. These links are used to check
                or uncheck specific items. With those link labels, that task
                is much easier to accomplish than with the checkboxes that were
                used in earlier versions.</p>

                </a>
                <p>The commit dialog now also shows a notification if there
                are updates for TortoiseSVN available, i.e., if you don't have
                the latest version installed. This replaces the separate dialog
                that popped up in previous versions since many users got annoyed
                by that pop up dialog.</p>

                <p>The repository browser shows folders that are included with
                the <code>svn:externals</code> property. It's also possible to
                browse to those folders, even if they are located in different
                repositories. The external folders are marked with a red arrow
                to distinguish them from normal folders in the repository.</p>

                <p>It's now also possible to edit a file directly from the
                repository browser. This makes it easy to make quick changes
                to a file without having to check out a whole working copy.</p>
                <p>Starting up the repository browser and browsing itself
                also got a lot faster in 1.7 due to heavy caching and pre-fetching
                information in the background.</p>

            <div class="post" id="sparse">
                <h2>Sparse checkouts</h2>
                <p>If you only need a working copy that has only a few folders
                of the project, you have to do a so called <code>sparse checkout</code>.
                In previous versions this was done in multiple steps by first
                checking out the parent folder with depth empty, then updating
                the folders you want one by one with the required depth.</p>
                <p>Now this is much easier: in the checkout dialog there's
                a button <code>choose items...</code> which opens a new dialog

                <h2>TortoiseMerge</h2>
                TortoiseMerge gained a few often requested features:
                <dl>
                    <dt>hiding of unchanged sections</dt>
                    <dd>Sections which do not contain any differences can be
                    hidden so that only the changes are visible. This helps
                    to get a better overview of the changes without too much
                    scrolling.</dd>
                    <dt>splitting of long lines</dt>
                    <dd>overly long lines are hard to view since they require
                    a lot of sideways scrolling. A new option allows to split
                    those lines into multiple lines when viewing so no
                    side-scrolling is necessary anymore.</dd>
                    <dt>marking of words</dt>
                    <dd>a doubleclick on a word/variable/statement/... marks
                    that word throughout the whole document. And the view bar
                    on the left also indicates where the same word/variable/statement
                    in the document can be found. This allows for a much easier
                    review of changes.</dd>

                <h2>Compatibility concerns</h2>

                <h3>Local Client Compatibility</h3>
                <p>Subversion working copies are sometimes accessed using
                several different clients, e.g. TortoiseSVN, AnkhSVN,
                and the svn command line client. Because the working copy format
                has changed with this release, 1.7 clients cannot access an earlier
                working copy without first upgrading it. Pre-1.7 clients cannot access
                1.7 working copies at all and there is no downgrade option.
                </p>
                <p>Migrating to 1.7 working copies must be considered a one-way
                operation. If you need to use multiple clients on the same working
                copy then be sure that you can update all the clients before upgrading
                the working copy.
                </p>

                <h3>Client Server Compatibility</h3>
                <p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.7
                servers and clients.  That is to say, you can use a 1.7 client with
                an older server, and you can use a 1.7 server with older clients.
                However, some of the new 1.7 features may
                not be available unless both client and server are the latest
                version.  There are also cases where a new feature will work
                but will run less efficiently if the client is new and the
                server old.</p>
