<!-- The class h2 is included on the main div, because the HTML which the
     server will wrap around the page includes a <div class="h2">.
     Thus, we include one here so that the page looks right when previewed
     locally, *but* we override the border which the CSS assigns to that
     style, so that we do not get two borders on the live page. -->

	<h2>Context menus in Windows Explorer</h2>
	<p>
	All commands are available through the context menu in the Windows
	Explorer. You can choose which entries TortoiseSVN should show in the
	top context menu and which it should put in the submenu.
	</p>
	<p>
	The context menu for versioned folders show the commands you can use on such folders.
	</p>
	<p><img alt="Context menu for versioned folders" src="images/ContextMenuDirControl.png"></p>
	<p>
	The context menu for unversioned folders shows commands where you can either create
	working copies, or commands you can use with URLs.
	</p>
	<p><img alt="Context menu for unversioned folders" src="images/ContextMenuDirNoControl.png"></p>
	<p>
	Not all commands which are available for versioned folders are also available for
	versioned files. Remember that Subversion is folder oriented unlike CVS which is more
	file oriented.
	</p>
	<p><img alt="Context menu for versioned files" src="images/ContextMenuFileControl.png"></p>
	<p>
	The menu for unversioned files has very few entries.
	</p>

	<p>
	Since moving and copying files/folders always has to be done via the Subversion commands,
	TortoiseSVN helps here too by adding entries to the right-drag context menu (select a file/folder, 
	right-drag it to another location and release the right mouse button):

	<h2>Icon overlays</h2>
	<p>
	Inside the Windows Explorer, TortoiseSVN shows you the state of the files with
	overlay icons. The following screenshot shows all available overlays, but usually you
	will only see a few of them.
	</p>

	<p>
	If you use the Windows Explorer in details view, TortoiseSVN can add additional
	columns so you have all the information available:
