					<p>Subversion's design is made up so that you will
					never ever lose any data. But there's one command
					that will do exactly that: <b>Revert</b>.<br/>
					Reverting means discarding all modifications you've
					made to one or more files which you haven't committed
					yet.</p>
					<p>But what if you selected the wrong file(s) to revert?
					Sure, TortoiseSVN always asks you first before it
					reverts the files. But as we all know, such &quot;Are you sure?&quot;
					dialogs are too easily dismissed by clicking &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>
					<p>So what if you reverted files and you then discover
					that you shouldn't have done that?<br/>
					If you used TortoiseSVN to revert, you can get the
					reverted changes back again! Because TortoiseSVN
					doesn't just revert your files but first moves them to the Windows
					recylcle bin (trash folder).<br/>
					<center><img src="images/recycle-bin.png" alt="Windows recycle bin"/></center>
					<br/>
					That means your changes aren't lost completely:
					you can find the files in the Windows recycle bin
					and restore them from there.</p>
					<div class="important">
					<h3>This is optional</h3>
					<p>
					Using the recycle bin is optional. In the settings
					dialog under &quot;Dialogs 1&quot; you can disable
					this (it's enabled by default) by unchecking the
					option &quot;Use recycle bin when reverting&quot;
