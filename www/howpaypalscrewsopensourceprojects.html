                <div class="entry">
                    <p>Some of our users might know that we have been accepting
                    donations to support us in developing TortoiseSVN for a
                    few years now. We used PayPal to achieve this, as do many
                    other open source projects and even some closed source
                    but free-of-cost projects.</p>
                    <p>Even the biggest hoster of open source projects,
                    <a href="http://sourceforge.net">sourceforge.net</a>, has a
                    special feature built into their project pages where every
                    project can <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Donations">activate</a>
                    such "donate" buttons, and that too is handled by PayPal.</p>

                    <p>Now imagine my surprise when I got an email from PayPal
                    last Wednesday with the subject <a href="files/paypal-1.txt">"PayPal appeal denied"</a>.
                    Because I never had to appeal anything with my PayPal account.
                    Reading through that email I discovered that my account was
                    blocked because they've decided that I'm not allowed to
                    receive donations.</p>
                    <p>This had me puzzled. Because I know that if a big company
                    like <a href="http://geek.net/">Geeknet Inc.</a>, the owner
                    of <a href="http://sourceforge.net">sourceforge.net</a> offers
                    to their users to use PayPal to receive donations, something
                    had to be wrong with PayPals decision to block my account.
                    So I asked for clarification and of course how I could get
                    all the money I have in my PayPal account back. All I got
                    was some lame <a href="files/paypal-2.txt">default answer</a>.</p>
                    <p>Not ready to give up, I tried to explain to them that
                    they had to had made a mistake here, giving them several
                    examples of other projects and of course sourceforge.net.
                    I wrote several emails, adding more and more arguments. The
                    first answer was again a lame <a href="files/paypal-3.txt">default pre-written crap</a>.
                    Then finally I got an email back from them which showed
                    that they actually have read at least one of my emails. But
                    that email didn't really answer my questions. Basically they
                    <a href="files/paypal-4.txt">admit</a> that <b>I didn't do
                    anything wrong</b> but that they won't admit their mistake
                    and that I'm still screwed: they will still hold my money
                    hostage for 180 days (If I ever get it back - something I'm
                    not sure about anymore).</p>

                    <p>If they're not allowed to let people use their accounts
                    to receive such donations because of some law, then they must
                    put that in their TOS. But there's nothing there (I checked).
                    And if the law changed, they still must tell that to their
                    users <b>before</b> they start closing accounts (which
                    didn't happen). Because how would I know of a change in law
                    in Singapore? I live in Switzerland!</p>
                    <p>All the emails I got from PayPal again in a list:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="files/paypal-1.txt">first email</a></li>
                        <li><a href="files/paypal-2.txt">second email</a></li>
                        <li><a href="files/paypal-3.txt">third email</a></li>
                        <li><a href="files/paypal-4.txt">last email</a></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>I always assumed that if you don't do anything wrong or
                    try to cheat that you'll be fine (1). PayPal now proves
                    me wrong.</p>
                    <p>I never used my PayPal account for something other than
                    to receive donations for TortoiseSVN. The only time I used
                    it to pay for something was when I bought a license for
                    <a href="http://www.wholetomato.com/">Visual Assist</a>.
                    But I consider that a fair use of the donations since I use
                    that license to write open source projects, like
                    <a href="/">TortoiseSVN</a> or other
                    various <a href="http://tools.tortoisesvn.net">tools</a>.</p>
                    <p>It's astonishing to me how a company is allowed to do
                    business that way. Imagine your car shop decides not to do
                    business with you anymore. No problem there, you just go to
                    another shop. But then the shop owner tells you that they
                    keep your car for half a year first because that's their
                    policy.<br/>
                    Basically, that's what PayPal does now with my money.</p>
                    <p>I'm sure I can find a way to cover the costs of our
                    servers another way, and until I get my money back from
                    PayPal I might have to pay for it myself.</p>

                    <p>Finally: A sincere warning to all the
                    <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/community/donate" title="Audacity">d</a><a href="http://www.getpaint.net/donate.html">e</a><a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=221450" title="SkyBlueCanvas">v</a><a href="http://www.vim.org/sponsor/index.php#methods" title="Vim">e</a><a href="http://www.openstv.org/donate">l</a><a href="http://keepass.info/donate.html">o</a><a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/donations.php">p</a><a href="http://winscp.net/eng/donate.php">e</a><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=41019" title="Password Safe">r</a><a href="http://www.pdfbox.org/donations.html">s</a> <a href="http://www.taskcoach.org/donations.html">o</a><a href="http://www.opencards.info/index.php/contribute-to-opencards">u</a><a href="http://desktopmanager.berlios.de/">t</a> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/donate/index.php?group_id=66565" title="Open Connector Groupware">t</a><a href="http://www.donationcoder.com/Donate/index.html">h</a><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=21558" title="FileZilla">e</a><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/project_donations.php?group_id=73280" title="Diskless Remote Boot in Linux (DRBL)">r</a><a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/donations/?lnk=5">e</a> (2)
                    who try to get a little bit of money for their hard work:
                    withdraw all the money from your PayPal accounts now,
                    before it's too late. As you can see, PayPal can screw you
                    any time they want.</p>

                    <p>And if you read this and know about other projects which
                    use PayPal to accept donations, please warn them before
                    they have their accounts blocked too.</p>
                    <p>If you want to discuss about this, please join the
                    <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=4061&amp;dsMessageId=2660447">thread</a>
                    on our mailing list.</p>

                    <h3>Update</h3>
                    <p>PayPal has restored my account. I received an
                    <a href="files/paypal-5.txt">email</a> from them asking
                    me to promise that I would never use the account to receive
                    donations anymore. Well, since I don't want to wait 180
                    days to get my money back and even then I wouldn't be able
                    to use the account anymore, I promised to not do that
                    anymore.</p>
                    <p>So I got my account back, but still can't use it to
                    donations to TortoiseSVN. I'm now waiting for the
                    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/ticket/13993">lawyers at SourceForge</a>
                    to find out what's going on.</p>

                    <h3>Update 2</h3>
                    <p>It took a while, but a lawyer from
                    <a href="http://geek.net/">Geeknet</a> was finally able to
                    get a real answer from PayPal. Even he as a lawyer had
                    troubles getting in contact with a real person there!</p>
                    <p>Bottom line: they finally admitted that they closed my
                    account accidentally and that accepting donations for
                    open source projects is <em>not</em> against their TOS.</p>
                    <p>Here's what they wrote back to the lawyer:
                    <blockquote><div>To follow up on this, I confirmed that the
                    PayPal restriction has been removed and the user can
                    accept donations through PayPal on the website below.
                    Donations for certain categories are restricted, but this
                    is not one of them.  The account has been flagged as
                    approved internally to hopefully avoid any future
                    issues.</div></blockquote>
                    We can now again accept donations to cover our server costs
                    via PayPal. Let's hope that the PayPal employees take a
                    course learning their own TOS so this never happens again.</p>

                    <p>(1) with the exception of course if you're the victim of
                    an accident or a crime.<br/>

                    in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=&amp;q=sourceforge+donations">this search</a>.</p>
