                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.9 is a superset of all previous TortoiseSVN releases,
                and is considered the current stable and "best" release. Anything in
                earlier versions is also in 1.9, but 1.9 contains features and
                bugfixes not present in any earlier release.</p>

                <p>This page describes only major changes. For a complete list
                of changes, you can check our
                <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/source/list">commit logs</a>
                and the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/issues/list?can=1&amp;q=label%3AMilestone-1.9.0">list of issues</a> for 1.9</p>

                <p>Don't forget to check out all the changes in the Subversion
                library that also is now at version 1.9: all those changes
                are of course in TortoiseSVN as well. See the full list
                of changes in the <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.9.html">Subversion 1.9 release notes</a>.</p>

                <h2>Requirements</h2>

                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.9 and later requires at least Windows Vista
                or later. It won't run on Windows XP anymore.</p>
                <p>If you're still need to use Windows XP, you have to keep
                using TortoiseSVN 1.8.</p>
            </div> <!-- requirements -->

            <div class="post" id="projectmonitor">
                <h2>Project Monitor</h2>

                <p>
                  The project monitor is a helpful tool that monitors repositories and
                  notifies you in case there are new commits.
                  If you already know the
                  <a href="http://stefanstools.sourceforge.net/CommitMonitor.html">Commit Monitor</a>,
                  then you're immediately familiar with the project monitor. The
                  project monitor is however more powerful since it can use the
                  full features of TortoiseSVN.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The projects can be monitored via a working copy path or directly via
                  their repository URLs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The project monitor scans each project in a configurable interval, and
                  every time new commits are detected a notification popup is shown.
                  Also the icon that is added to the system tray changes to indicate that
                  there are new commits.

            <div class="post" id="sync">
                <h2>Sync/Export/Import settings</h2>

                <p>All settings that are configurable in the settings dialog
                can be synchronized to a specific file, or manually exported/imported.
                This allows to set up new workstations much easier and quicker.</p>
                <p>If the specified path for the sync feature is on a cloud drive
                like Onedrive/GDrive/Dropbx/..., then changes made to settings
                are automatically synchronized to all other workstations
                that use the same cloud drive and have set their sync paths
                accordingly.</p>
                <p>More information about which settings and which data is
                synchronized can be found in the <a href="/docs/nightly/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-settings.html#tsvn-dug-settings-export">documentation</a>.</p>

            <div class="post" id="shellmenu">
                <h2>Explorer menu in status dialogs</h2>

                <p>All dialogs that show status information like the commit
                dialog, check-for-modifications dialog, revert dialog, ... now
                have an entry in the context menu named <code>Shell</code>.
                This entry expands to the same context menu the Windows
                explorer shows for that path. This avoids having to go back
                and forth between TortoiseSVN and the Windows explorer to
                do certain tasks.</p>

            <div class="post" id="subwcrevignore">
                <h2>Ignore option for SubWCRev</h2>
                <p>SubWCRev, the command line tool to gather information about a working
                copy, has now an option to ignore files or whole paths. The ignored
                paths/patterns need to be written to a text file named <code>.subwcrevignore</code>
                in the working copy.</p>
                <p>A more detailed description of this new feature can be found
                in the <a href="/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-subwcrev.html#tsvn-subwcrev-cli">documentation</a>.</p>

            <div class="post" id="imgconflicts">
                <h2>Conflict resolving for images</h2>
                <p>The image diff tool TortoiseIDiff can now help resolving
                conflicts of images as well. In a conflict situation, it will
                show all three images that take part in a conflict, and lets
                you chose which one to keep/use.</p>

                <h2>Bookmarks in the repository browser</h2>
                <p>The repository browser can not show a list of
                bookmarked repository URLs. This allows to faster browse
                often used repositories, without having to first enter
                the URL manually or find the corresponding working copy.</p>

                <h2>Add svn:externals property by right-dragging</h2>
                <p>Files and folders that are dragged from one working
                copy to another with the right mouse button down can be
                automatically added as externals to the dropped working copy.</p>

            <div class="post" id="checkcommit">
                <h2>Check-Commit hook</h2>
                <p>A new hook is available that is called right before
                the commit dialog is closed. If the hook script returns an error,
                the commit dialog is kept open so users can fix the problems
                right there, before the commit is tried.</p>
                <p>This is useful in case a hook script has to ensure a certain
                format of the commit message, or scan all files that are to be committed
                first.</p>
                <p>Another hook is available that if set, shows a button in the commit dialog which when
                clicked runs that hook script.</p>
