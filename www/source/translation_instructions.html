        <p>TortoiseSVN is still in development so the translation
        of all resources is also a work 'in progress'.</p>

        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>The TortoiseSVN project uses gettext PO (portable object)
        files for its translation. PO files are plain text, so you
        can even translate using a normal text editor. The only
        thing you have to take care of is that the editor can handle
        the UTF-8 charset. There is a wide range of tools out there
        that can handle and manipulate PO files.</p>
        
        <h3>How to translate</h3>
        <p>
            Visit <a href="https://transifex.com">transifex.com</a> and register an account there.
            After having done this, go to the <a href="https://explore.transifex.com/luebbe/tortoisesvn/">TortoiseSVN translation project</a>
            and request to join a language team of your choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Transifex has a nice web interface. You can edit everything there, but you can also download
            the .po file, work offline using your preferred editor and upload the .po file to transifex again.
        </p>
        <p>
            We take care of synchronizing the translations between transifex.com and our repository.
