                <p>At the Subversion live event in London yesterday one of the
                users asked me whether TortoiseSVN 1.7 would provide a way to
                customize the context menu entries, so that he could remove
                certain entries/commands for certain users.</p>
                <p>I was a little bit surprised, because that can already be
                done using TortoiseSVn 1.6.x.</p>
                <p>But this made me realize that more users or administrators are
                not aware of that feature, and maybe other features as well.</p>
                <p>We have a full chapter in our docs with useful tips for
                administrators or users who have to watch other less advanced
                users.</p>
                <p>That chapter is called
                &quot;<a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-admins.html">Useful Tips For Administrators</a>&quot;
                and the part about how to remove entries from the context menu
                is called &quot;<a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-admins-disablemenus.html">Disable context menu entries</a>&quot;.</p>
                <p>You don't need to wait for TortoiseSVN 1.7 to get this feature,
                it's already implemented in TortoiseSVN 1.6.x</p>
