    <h1 class="title">Extended context menu</h1>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>Many people don't know that the Windows shell provides an
        extended context menu if the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key is pressed
        when the menu is shown. <br/>For example, on Vista the
        extended menu has a few additional entries. The screenshots
        below show this: the left menu is the normal, plain menu
        and the right menu is the extended menu which you get if
        you hold down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while right clicking:</p>

        <div class="centered">
            <img src="/assets/img/VistaPlainMenu.png" alt="VistaPlainMenu" width="269" height="335">
            <img src="/assets/img/VistaExtendedMenu.png" alt="VistaExtendedMenu" width="270" height="379">
        </div>

        <p>As you can see, the extended menu has the additional
        entry "<em>Open Command Window Here</em>" which opens a
        console window with the current path set to that folder,
        and the entry "<em>Copy as Path</em>" which copies the
        path of the file/folder to the clipboard.</p>
        <p>However if you try this on the explorer tree view on the
        left, it won't work. The extended menu is only available
        on the right file/folder view.</p>
        <p>TortoiseSVN uses the extended menu too. Some commands
        are only available in the context menu if you hold down
        the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while right clicking. These are
        commands which we think are not used a lot (but of course
        are still useful), or commands that require the user to
        fully <strong>understand the consequences</strong> of using
        that command (which requires the user to read the
        <a href="/support.html">docs</a>!).</p>

        <p>The screenshot on the left is the normal context menu,
        and the menu on the right is the extended context menu.</p>

            <img src="/assets/img/TSVNNormalMenu.png" alt="TSVNNormalMenu" width="186" height="565">
            <img src="/assets/img/TSVNExtendedMenu.png" alt="TSVNExtendedMenu" width="220" height="673">
        </div>
        <p>
        Note: On XP, the extended context menu only works on the
        list view, not on the tree view!<br/>
        The commands only available from the extended menu are
        "<a href="/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-diff.html#tsvn-dug-diff-file"><em>Diff with URL</em></a>",
        "<a href="/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-rename.html#tsvn-dug-rename-delete"><em>Delete (keep local)</em></a>",
        "<a href="/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-rename.html#tsvn-dug-rename-del-unversioned"><em>Delete unversioned items...</em></a>",
        "<a href="/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-locking.html#tsvn-dug-locking-unlock"><em>Break lock</em></a>"
        and
        "<a href="/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-merge.html#tsvn-dug-merge-all"><em>Merge reintegrate...</em></a>".
