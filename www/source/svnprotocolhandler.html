    <div class="entry">
        <p>Subversion repositories served with Apache have the nice
        built-in feature: the repositories can be browsed with
        any webbrowser at no additional cost.</p>
        <p>For Subversion repositories served via svnserve, this
        is not possible because browsers don't understand that
        protocol.</p>
        <p>Until now:<br/>
        The SVNProtocolHandler for Internet Explorer allows
        browsing <code>svn://</code> urls from within the Internet Explorer.
        No need to install a Subversion client, just use Internet Explorer. This
        also adds the benefit that you can click on <code>svn://</code> links
        and quickly the URL you received from a colleague via email.</p>

            <img src="/assets/img/IE1-small.png" alt="Internet Explorer" width="231" height="169">
        </a>

        <p>Note: the protocol handler only works in Internet
        Explorer. Chrome, Firefox etc. users either have to switch back to Internet Explorer
        for SVN browsing or hope someone will create an <code>svn://</code>
        handler for them.</p>
        <p>The installer for the SVNProtocolHandler can be found
        on the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/svnprotocolhandler/files/">download page</a>.<br/>
        Note: even though the SVNProtocolHandler is developed by
        <a href="/stefan_kueng.html">Stefan KÃ¼ng</a>, it is
        not part of TortoiseSVN and won't be included in
        TortoiseSVN either. It will remain a separate download,
        and it has its own
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/svnprotocolhandler">project page</a>.
