        <p>TortoiseSVN is an
        <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Apache<sup>&trade;</sup> Subversion (SVN)<sup>&reg;</sup></a>
        client, implemented as a Windows shell extension.
        It's intuitive and easy to use, since it doesn't
        require the Subversion command line client to run.
        And it is free to use, even in a commercial environment.
        Simply the coolest Interface to (Sub)Version Control!</p>

        If you're using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718325.aspx">Visual Studio</a>,
        you can integrate TortoiseSVN commands to various context menus.
        Of course, there are Subversion plugins for Visual Studio,
        but if you're using one of the free versions of Visual Studio,
        you can not use those plugins. And sometimes it's
        still nice to have some of the TortoiseSVN commands
        available from Visual Studio directly, even if you have
        such a plugin installed.
