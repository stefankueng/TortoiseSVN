                <div class="entry">
                    <p>TortoiseSVN has many features. Most of the time, you
                    won't need all the features it has but only a few,
                    depending on the projects you work on. But there are some
                    features which you would use if you only knew they were
                    there.</p>

                    <p>Now you might say that if a feature is not obvious right
                    away, and so hidden so that you don't even know it is there,
                    then the UI should be improved to make that feature more
                    obvious. And you are right.</p>

                    <p>But sometimes it is not possible to do that, or we simply
                    don't know how.</p>

                    <p>This is one of those situations:</p>

                    <h3>Right drag</h3>
                    <p>In the Windows explorer, it is possible to move/copy
                    files not only by dragging them with the left mouse button,
                    but also with the right mouse button. The difference is
                    that the left-drag executes the operation immediately, and
                    the right-drag will first show you a context menu where
                    you can choose the operation.</p>

                    <p>TortoiseSVN adds some of its commands to that right-drag
                    context menu. The screenshot below shows the menu when you
                    drag unversioned files/folders on to a versioned folder:</p>

                    <img class="img-centered" src="/img/rightdrag-u2v.png" alt="The right-drag context menu when dragging unversioned items onto a versioned folder">

                    <p>As you can see in the screenshot, TortoiseSVN allows
                    you to add the files/folders to the working copy. This
                    first moves or copies the files to the working copy, then
                    does an "SVN Add".</p>
                    <p>The entry "Apply patch" only shows up if you drag a
                    <em>*.patch</em> or <em>*.diff</em> file onto a working copy.
                    That command will open up TortoiseMerge, allowing you to
                    apply the patchfile to that working copy location.</p>

                    <p>Next is the context menu you will see if you right-drag
                    versioned files/folders <strong>from</strong> your working copy to an
                    unversioned folder:</p>

                    <img class="img-centered" src="/img/rightdrag-v2u.png" alt="The right-drag context menu when dragging versioned items onto an unversioned folder">

                    <p>These commands let you export your items:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>SVN Export to here: exports the dragged files/folders
                        to the target location, i.e. creates a copy without
                        the .svn folders</li>
                        <li>SVN Export all to here: exports the dragged
                        files/folders to the target location, including
                        unversioned files.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>And last but not least, the commands you get when you
                    right-drag files/folders inside your working copy:</p>
                    <img class="img-centered" src="/img/rightdrag-v2v.png" alt="The right-drag context menu when dragging versioned items inside a working copy">

                    <p>These commands help you move and copy your files and
                    folders around in your working copy:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>SVN Move versioned files here: moves the files to
                        the drop location. If a file already exists, it will
                        ask you what to do (rename the file, overwrite it or
                        cancel).</li>
                        <li>SVN Move and rename versioned files here: the same
                        as 'SVN Move versioned files here', except that it will
                        ask for a new name for every dropped file.</li>
                        <li>SVN Copy versioned files here: the same as 'SVN Move
                        versioned files here' but it leaves the original file,
                        i.e. the file is copied not moved</li>
                        <li>SVN Copy and rename versioned files here: the same
                        as 'SVN Move and rename versioned files here' but it
                        leaves the original file, i.e. the files are copied
                        not moved</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Now what are these features really good for? Well, you
                    will know as soon as you start using them :)<br/>
                    Seriously: these commands are really useful if you want to
                    reorganize your working copy, move and copy files around
                    or if you simply want to export your working copy to
                    another folder.
