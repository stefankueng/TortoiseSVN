        <p>Would you like to translate TortoiseSVN into your native language?</p>

        <p>To check the currently available languages, take a look at our
        <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn">Translation status page</a>. Maybe your language
        already exists and is ready for use or needs just a little improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
        A while ago we decided to move to a web based translation platform at
        <a href="https://transifex.com">transifex.com</a>. We think this makes it easier
        for new translators to get started. If you want to help to translate TortoiseSVN,
        please register an account at <a href="https://transifex.com">transifex.com</a>, then
        request membership of one of our
        <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn">translation teams</a>
        or request to create a new team, if your language is not yet listed.
        </p>
        <p>
        We will run some sanity checks on it and commit it into our repository.
        From that moment on, an installer for your language will be available in the
        nightly development builds for testing. It'll become part of the next official
        release. We will also put your name on the <a href="/translator_credits.html">list of contributors</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now go ahead and <a href="/downloads.html">download</a> your favourite language pack.
