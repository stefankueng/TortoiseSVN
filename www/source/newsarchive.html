    <h2 class="title">TortoiseSVN 1.8.4 released</h2>
    <p class="meta">Posted on November 24, 2013</p>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>
        We're proud to announce that TortoiseSVN 1.8.4 has been released.
        It is linked against Subversion 1.8.5.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is a bugfix release with no new features.
        </p>
        <p>Note that Subversion 1.8.5 fixes a security vulnerability (CVE-2013-4558).
        But this only affects Subversion servers, so TortoiseSVN is not affected.
        </p>
        <p>
        Before upgrading from pre 1.8 versions please read the
        <a href="/tsvn_1.8_releasenotes.html">release notes</a>.

        <p>
        Please read those <strong>thoroughly</strong> before you upgrade to
        TortoiseSVN 1.8 to avoid any surprises.
        </p>
        <p>We've also updated the <a href="/svnprotocolhandler.html">SVNProtocolHandler</a> to match the new Subversion release.</p>
        <p>
        <a href="http://stefanstools.sourceforge.net/BowPad.html">BowPad</a>

        <p>TortoiseSVN 1.6.16 has been released.</p>
        <p>This is a bugfix release/maintenance release,
        linked with Subversion 1.6.17.</p>
        <p>Subversion 1.6.17 also contains a few security related
        fixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2011-1752-advisory.txt">CVE-2011-1752</a></li>

        </ul>
        <p>Note: these vulnerabilities only refer to Subversion
        servers, not clients. Which means TortoiseSVN is not affected
        by those.</p>
        <p>We still recommend that you update your TortoiseSVN client to
        this latest version. You can get it from our
        <a href="/downloads.html">download</a> page.</p>
        <p>Also note that if you upgrade from a version before
        1.6.10, you have to run a repair install after the upgrade.
        To do that, run the installer again and click the "Repair"
        button. I'm sorry about the inconvenience.</p>
        <p>If you want to know why the repair install is required,
        you can read about the technical details in my

        <p>A few weeks ago, we received a sponsorship from <a href="http://ooshirts.com">ooShirts</a>,
        which will allow us to create and order some custom designed T-Shirts for TortoiseSVN.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/news/TShirtSample.png" alt="T-Shirt">
        <p>Since we are never short on coding ideas, but on design ideas, we decided to put up a T-Shirt contest.</p>
        <p>The contest will start today and run for four weeks. The final date for your submission is Monday, 19th September, 2011.</p>
        <p>We will set up an image gallery with the submissions and allow users to vote on them.
        Voting will be up for ten days</p>
        <p>The <strong>winner of the contest</strong>, as well as the two runners-up <strong>will receive a free T-Shirt</strong> :)</p>
        <p>We have only two requirements for the T-Shirt:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The T-Shirt must show a Tortoise, an SVG logo to start with can be found in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/tortoisesvn/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/doc/logo/tsvn_logo.svg">our repository</a>)</li>
        <li>The T-Shirt must display the text "TortoiseSVN"</li>

    <h2 class="title">Call for translators</h2>
    <p class="meta">Posted on July 14, 2011</p>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>
        in a few weeks, Subversion 1.7 will be officially released.
        This means that TortoiseSVN 1.7 will be released only a few days later.
        Now it's high time to polish up our translations and finish as many of them as possible.
        In most cases the biggest item on the to-do list is the TortoiseSVN manual.
        </p>
        <p>
        There are five translations where the GUI translation is almost finished and the manual
        is more than 90% done.
        These are:
        <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/nl/">Dutch</a>,
        <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/fr/">French</a>,
        <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/ja/">Japanese</a>,
        <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/ru/">Russian</a> and
        <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/es/">Spanish</a>.
        If at least two volunteers help, we should be able to deliver a 100% complete translation for these languages.
        </p>
        <p>
        Close behind are:
        <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/zh_CN/">Chinese</a> and
        <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/sl/">Slovenian</a>.
        Their manuals are &gt; 70% finished, but this is going to be a tough job to get it done.
        </p>
        <p>
        Then we have the
        <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/id/">Indonesian</a>,
        <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/pl/">Polish</a>,
        <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/pt_BR/">Portuguese (Brazil)</a> and
        <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/sk/">Slovak</a>
        manuals, which are between 40% and 60% done. It would be cool to get close to 100%,
        but a lot of work to achieve this goal. The Polish translator is currently very active
        and would surely appreciate any help.
        </p>
        <p>
        Finally there are several languages where no manual exists, but the GUI translation
        is &gt;70% complete. See the <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/resource/trunk-gui/">GUI translation statistics</a>.
        These are the easiest jobs to finish, because the GUI translation
        doesn't have long paragraphs, but many single words or short sentences to translate.
        </p>
        <p>
        Please come and help. We need *you* :) Some information on how to join the translation
        team is available on our <a href="/translation.html">translation page</a>.

    <p class="meta">Posted on March 23, 2011</p>
    <div class="entry">
        <p>TortoiseSVN 1.6.15 has been released.</p>
        <p>This is a bugfix release/maintenance release,
        linked with Subversion 1.6.16. The release contains a fix
        for a first-chance exception in the file open/save dialogs.
        This only affects applications which are run under a debugger
        which must also be configured to catch first-chance exceptions.
        But since TortoiseSVN is mostly used by developers, this
        is annoying so that's why we made this release only a few
        days after the last release. Sorry about that.</p>
        <p>We recommend that you update your TortoiseSVN client to
        this latest version. You can get it from our
        <a href="/downloads.html">download</a> page.</p>
        <p>Also note that if you upgrade from a version before
        1.6.10, you have to run a repair install after the upgrade.
        To do that, run the installer again and click the "Repair"
        button. I'm sorry about the inconvenience.</p>
        <p>If you want to know why the repair install is required,
