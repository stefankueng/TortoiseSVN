    <p>TortoiseSVN 1.14 is a superset of all previous TortoiseSVN releases,
    and is considered the current stable and "best" release. Anything in
    earlier versions is also in 1.14, but 1.14 contains features and
    bugfixes not present in any earlier release.</p>

    <p>This page describes only major changes. For a complete list
    of changes, you can check our
    <a href="https://osdn.net/projects/tortoisesvn/scm/svn/">commit logs</a></p>

    <p>Don't forget to check out all the changes in the Subversion
    library that also is now at version 1.14: all those changes
    are of course in TortoiseSVN as well. See the full list
    of changes in the <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.14.html">Subversion 1.14 release notes</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>TortoiseSVN 1.14 is the new Long-Term Support (LTS) release.

<div class="post" id="requirements">
    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <p>TortoiseSVN 1.10 and later requires at least Windows 7
    or later. It won't run on Windows Vista anymore.</p>
    <p>If you're still need to use those earlier OS, you have to keep
    using TortoiseSVN 1.9 for Windows Vista or TortoiseSVN 1.8 for Windows XP.</p>

<div class="post" id="shelving">
    <h2>Shelving and Unshelving</h2>

    <p>
      Subversion 1.14 enables both version 2 and version 3 of the shelving
      functions. The version can be changed via the environment variable
      <em>SVN_EXPERIMENTAL_COMMANDS</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please have a look at the <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.14#shelving-enabling">Subversion notes</a>
      about what values this variable can take.
      Note that if the variable is not set, TortoiseSVN defaults to <em>v2</em>.
    </p>
</div> <!-- shelving -->

<div class="post" id="darkmode">
    <h2>Dark mode</h2>

    <p>
      You can enable a dark mode for all TortoiseSVN tools, i.e. TortoiseMerge,
      TortoiseIDiff, TortoiseUDiff, TortoiseBlame and even TortoiseSVN itself.
      The dark mode is enabled individually for each tool.
    </p>
    <div class="important">
      <h3>Windows 10</h3>
      <p>
        Dark mode can only be enabled for Windows 10 1809 and later.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      For the TortoiseSVN dialogs, dark mode is available through the advanced
      settings page since not all controls are drawn in proper dark colors
      and therefore might not be suitable for all users.
