        <p>TortoiseSVN allows you to specify your own tool for
        showing diffs and/or merges. For example, a lot of people
        prefer <a href="http://winmerge.org/">WinMerge</a> over
        <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/TortoiseMerge.html">TortoiseMerge</a> (
        even though I can't see why :-) ).</p>

        <p>But sometimes you might want to prefer TortoiseMerge
        over your custom diff tool. Changing the settings would be
        way too complicated to just use TortoiseMerge once, for
        this particular situation.</p>
        <p>TortoiseSVN allows you to use TortoiseMerge easily,
        without changing your custom diff tool setup: just hold
        down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key when you click on the context menu to
        do the diff. If the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key is pressed when doing a diff,
        TortoiseSVN always uses TortoiseMerge. If the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key is
        not pressed, the diff/merge tool specified in your settings
        is used.</p>
