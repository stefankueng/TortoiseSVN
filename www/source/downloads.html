        <h3>Context menu in file-open/save dialogs on x64 OS</h3>
        <p>
        On x64 versions of Windows 7 and 8, the TortoiseSVN context menu and overlays
        won't show for 32-bit applications in their file-open/save dialogs until
        you install the
        <a href="https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x86.exe">2017 C-runtime for x86</a>.
        (select the <em>vc_redist.x86.exe</em> file for download).
        </p>
        <p>
        Note: this only applies to 32-bit applications on x64 OS. The Windows explorer
        is not affected by this.

        <h1>Forthcoming Releases</h1>
        <p>To find out what is happening with the project and when
        you can expect the next major release, take a look at our
        <a href="/status.html">project status</a> page.</p>

        <h1 id="prerelease">Stable Branch Builds</h1>
        <p>We maintain ongoing
        <a href="https://nightlybuilds.tortoisesvn.net/1.14.x/">Release Candidates</a>
        as well. These contain the latest official release plus latest bugfixes and will eventually become
        the next official release. They are not built nightly, but on demand from the current release branch,
        typically once a week if there has been any significant bugfix activity. If you find that a
        certain bug has been fixed and you do not want to wait until the next release, install one of these.
        Because they are built from the stable branch they should be completely compatible with
        the current official release and with other compatible Subversion clients.
        You would also help us tremendously by installing and testing release candidates.
        Note that the stable branch accepts bugfixes only, not new features.</p>

        <h1>Trunk Nightly Builds</h1>
        <p><a href="https://nightlybuilds.tortoisesvn.net/latest/">Nightly Builds</a> are
        available too. They are built from the current development head and are for testing only.
        This represents the bleeding edge and may be linked against a newer version of the subversion
        libraries than is used for the current release. Working copies may be upgraded automatically
        and become incompatible with the official release and with other subversion clients.
        We would love you to test these builds, but you should be aware of the potential problems
        and install only on a machine where your working copies are not critical.
        Note: This requires Windows 7 or above.</p>

        <h1>Older Releases</h1>
        <p>Older releases are available from the
        <a href="https://osdn.net/projects/tortoisesvn/storage/">OSDN.net files</a> section.</p>

        <h1>Source Code</h1>

        The source code is hosted on

        in our own Subversion repository. You can browse the
