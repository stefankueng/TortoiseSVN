    <p>TortoiseSVN 1.12 is a superset of all previous TortoiseSVN releases,
    and is considered the current stable and "best" release. Anything in
    earlier versions is also in 1.12, but 1.12 contains features and
    bugfixes not present in any earlier release.</p>

    <p>This page describes only major changes. For a complete list
    of changes, you can check our
    <a href="https://osdn.net/projects/tortoisesvn/scm/svn/">commit logs</a></p>

    <p>Don't forget to check out all the changes in the Subversion
    library that also is now at version 1.10: all those changes
    are of course in TortoiseSVN as well. See the full list
    of changes in the <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.12.html">Subversion 1.12 release notes</a>.</p>

<div class="post" id="requirements">
    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <p>TortoiseSVN 1.10 and later requires at least Windows 7
    or later. It won't run on Windows Vista anymore.</p>
    <p>If you're still need to use those earlier OS, you have to keep
    using TortoiseSVN 1.9 for Windows Vista or TortoiseSVN 1.8 for Windows XP.</p>

<div class="post" id="shelving">
    <h2>Shelving and Unshelving</h2>

    <p>
      Subversion 1.12 has a new experimental feature called <code>checkpointing</code>
      which is enabled in TortoiseSVN 1.12.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feature allows you to shelve local changes, work on something else and commit
      and then unshelve those stored changes again.
    </p>
    <div class="important">
    <h3>existing shelves</h3>
    <p>
    If you've created shelves in TortoiseSVN 1.10 and haven't applied them yet, please
    apply them before updating to TortoiseSVN 1.12. The old shelves can not be used
    in 1.12 anymore.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="warning">
    <h3>experimental</h3>
    <p>
    The shelving feature is still marked as <em>experimental</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
    That means that while shelving works as advertised, it is still in a stage where
    it's heavily improved and worked on. That also means that there's no guarantee that
    the shelves you create are upwards compatible and future versions might not be able
    to use them. And of course the UI might change as well in future versions to accommodate
    new features and behaviors.
    </p>

<div class="post" id="various">
    <h2>Various improvements</h2>

    <p>Various bugfixes.</p>
    <p>All features implemented that are present in the svn library 1.12</p>
