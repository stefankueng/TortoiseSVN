Dear Stefan Kueng,

Thank you for contacting PayPal. We totally understand you concerns.

Online donations/contribution to non-charitable organizations may be deemed
to be a remittance-related activity by Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS), PayPal Private Limited‘s regulator, and unfortunately PayPal is
currently not authorized to conduct such activities. PayPal is registered
as a stored value facility (“SVF”) in Singapore, and it is a facility that
is used for payment of goods or services up to its stored value. Therefore,
activity that does not include goods/services exchange will be prohibited.

You may also refer to the terms and legislation issued by MAS via
www.mas.gov.sg/. It is not specific to you, your organization, or your
country, but applies to all users who online contracted with PayPal Private
Limited. As outlined in PayPal Acceptable Use Policy
(https://cms.paypal.com/ch/cgi-bin/?&cmd=_render-content&content_ID=ua/AcceptableUse_full&locale.x=en_US), collecting donations as a non-profit
organization, free software developer inclusive, is a service requiring
pre-approval. Unfortunately, your account did not obtain such authorization
at that time.

As to the remaining balance, you may issue a refund from your account to
the person who sent you the funds. They will need to find an alternate
method to remit these monies to you. Or any funds in your PayPal account
balance will be held for 180 days from the date the limitation was
originally placed on the account.  The balance is held to cover any
disputes that may be filed against the account.  You may contact us after
180 days regarding the release of any remaining balance. For the Terms and
Conditions of the User Agreement, click the "Legal Agreement" link at the
bottom of any PayPal webpage and click "User Agreement". Or click the link:
https://cms.paypal.com/ch/cgi-bin/?&cmd=_render-content&content_ID=ua/ClosingAcct_full&locale.x=en_US.

Also, the website you reported will be reviewed for compliance with our
User Agreement and Acceptable Use Policy. While we do not discuss issues
related to individual PayPal accounts, rest assured that we actively
enforce the terms of our agreements. You can also report potential
violations of our policies through this link:
https://www.paypal.com/ewf/f=pps_prohib.

We respectfully ask that you seek another method of payment for your online
business. Again, we apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused.

Sincerely,
Nolan
PayPal Compliance Department
PayPal, an eBay Company
