Dear Stefan Kueng,=20

Thank you for contacting PayPal.=20

We understand your concern about your PayPal account. I would like to=20
extend my personal apologies for the inconvenience this might have=20

non-registered charities and non-profit organizations (NPOs), political=20
party/organizations, religious institutions, personal/organizational=20

Therefore, I am sorry we are unable to restore your account. Your PayPal

to register a new PayPal account with a different email address. Please=20
note creating a new PayPal account for the same purpose is strictly=20
prohibited by PayPal Policy under PayPal Pte Ltd.

Your PayPal balance can be handled in one of two ways:

1. Your remaining account balance can be used to refund the senders. You
can refund payments received in 60 days by yourself. For the payments=20
received older than 60 days, please send us email at apacdd@paypal.com=20
with a list of senders you would like to refund. Include the email=20
address, date, amount of the transaction and transaction ID.
