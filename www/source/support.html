        <h3>Older Manuals</h3>
        <p>Older releases are available from the
        <a href="https://osdn.net/projects/tortoisesvn/storage/">OSDN.net files</a> section.</p>

        <h3>Professional Support</h3>
        <p>A lot of companies also offer professional support. Some
        of them are also active in the development of Subversion
        itself and have hired developers who work actively on the
        projects.</p>

        <h3>Project Status</h3>
        <p>Have a look at our <a href="/status.html">project status</a>
        page to see what we are working on at the moment, and to
        check the release history.</p>

        <h3>TortoiseSVN book</h3>
        <p>The <a href="http://link.packtpub.com/qcmkxs">TortoiseSVN 1.7 Beginner's Guide</a> is a
        well written book, as its title says for beginners. But
        it is not available for free.
        I've also written a <a href="/beginnersguide.html">small review</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Subversion book</h3>
        <p>Read the official Subversion book
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596510330/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0596510330&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=to0d-20&amp;linkId=LFU5LJ45CYBLTFPK">Version Control with Subversion</a>
        <img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=to0d-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0596510330" width="1" height="1" alt="wtf" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
        to find out what it's all about. This book explains the
        general concepts of Subversion. It's no must, but it'll
        give you deep insight. There's also a
        <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">free online version</a> available.</p>

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <p>A list of common problems and their solutions can be
        found in the <a href="/faq.html">FAQ</a>. Please note that
        the FAQ contains answers, but is not the place to ask
        questions. For that you need to go to the users mailing list.
        When we have a good answer to a good question we post it
        in the FAQ.</p>

        <h3>Mailing list</h3>
        <p>If your question is not answered in any of these places,
        you can subscribe to one of our two mailing lists:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The users list, where we deal with the howto
        (configuration, daily work, ...). If there is something you
        don't understand, feel free to ask a question here and you
        will usually get a rapid response.</li>
        <li>The developer list, where we discuss the internals of
        TortoiseSVN (bugs, features, enhancements, ...). If you
        want to contribute to the project, this is where the
        development discussions take place.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please have a look at our <a href="/community.html">community page</a>
        to find out how to subscribe to and search those mailing lists.</p>
