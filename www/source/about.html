    <div class="entry">
        <p>TortoiseSVN is a really easy to use
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">Revision control</a>
        / version control / source control software for Windows. It is based on
        <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Apache<sup>&trade;</sup> Subversion (SVN)<sup>&reg;</sup></a>;
        TortoiseSVN provides a nice and easy user interface for Subversion.</p>
        <p>It is developed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html#SEC1">GPL</a>.
        Which means it is completely free for anyone to use, including in a commercial environment,
        without any restriction. The source code is also freely available, so you can even
        develop your own version if you wish to.</p>
        <p>Since it's not an integration for a <em>specific</em>
        IDE like Visual Studio, Eclipse or others, you can use it
        with whatever development tools you like, and with any type of file.</p>

            <li>TortoiseSVN is stable
                <ul>
                    <li>Before every release, we create one or more "release candidates" for adventurous people to test first.</li>
                    <li>During development cycles, many people test intermediate builds. These are built every night automatically
                        and made available to all our users. This helps finding bugs very early so they won't even get into an
                        official release.</li>
                    <li>A big user community helps out with testing each build before we release it.</li>
                    <li>A custom crash report tool is included in every TortoiseSVN release which helps us fix the bugs
                        much faster, even if you can't remember exactly what you did to trigger it.</li>
