                    <p>Moving and renaming versioned files inside a working copy
                    must always be done with the corresponding
                    Subversion/TortoiseSVN commands. A move/rename without
                    those (e.g., with the Windows Explorer) leads to problems
                    since Subversion doesn't know that you have moved/renamed
                    the files.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you rename a file named <em>myfile.txt</em>
                    to <em>myfile2.txt</em> without using the Subversion/TortoiseSVN
                    command, <em>myfile.txt</em> will show up as "missing" and
                    <em>myfile2.txt</em> as "non-versioned" in the commit
                    dialog or the Check-For-Modifications dialog.</p>

                    <p>If that happens to you, TortoiseSVN offers you an easy
                    way to correct this. The following screenshot shows how
                    the file <em>TSVN-Support.ods</em> was renamed to
                    <em>TortoiseSVN-Support.ods</em> without the proper
                    commands. They show up in the commit dialog as "missing"
                    and "non-versioned". In the commit (or the
                    Check-For-Modifications) dialog, you can select both
                    files (Ctrl-click), right-click and choose "Repair move"
                    from the context menu:</p>

                    <p><img src="img/repairmove.png" alt="Repair Move"></p>

                    <p>The "Repair move" command only works if exactly two files
                    are selected, one having the "missing" and the other the
                    "non-versioned" status. Only that way TortoiseSVN can find
                    out which file got renamed to which file. By executing the
                    command, TortoiseSVN repeats the rename but using the proper
                    Subversion move/rename command:</p>
