    <div class="entry">
        <p>Moving and renaming versioned files inside a working copy
        must always be done with the corresponding
        Subversion/TortoiseSVN commands. A move/rename without
        those (e.g., with the Windows Explorer) leads to problems
        since Subversion doesn't know that you have moved/renamed
        the files.</p>
        <p>For example, if you rename a file named <em>myfile.txt</em>
        to <em>myfile2.txt</em> without using the Subversion/TortoiseSVN
        command, <em>myfile.txt</em> will show up as "missing" and
        <em>myfile2.txt</em> as "non-versioned" in the commit
        dialog or the Check-For-Modifications dialog.</p>

        <p>If that happens to you, TortoiseSVN offers you an easy
        way to correct this. The following screenshot shows how
        the file <em>TSVN-Support.ods</em> was renamed to
        <em>TortoiseSVN-Support.ods</em> without the proper
        commands. They show up in the commit dialog as "missing"
        and "non-versioned". In the commit (or the
        Check-For-Modifications) dialog, you can select both
        files <kbd>Ctrl+click</kbd>, right-click and choose "Repair move"
        from the context menu:</p>

        <p>The "Repair move" command only works if exactly two files
        are selected, one having the "missing" and the other the
        "non-versioned" status. Only that way TortoiseSVN can find
        out which file got renamed to which file. By executing the
        command, TortoiseSVN repeats the rename but using the proper
        Subversion move/rename command:</p>
