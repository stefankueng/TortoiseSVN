    <div class="entry">
        <p>Subversion's design is made up so that you will
        never ever lose any data. But there's one command
        that will do exactly that: <strong>Revert</strong>.<br/>
        Reverting means discarding all modifications you've
        made to one or more files which you haven't committed
        yet.</p>
        <p>But what if you selected the wrong file(s) to revert?
        Sure, TortoiseSVN always asks you first before it
        reverts the files. But as we all know, such &quot;Are you sure?&quot;
        dialogs are too easily dismissed by clicking &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>
        <p>So what if you reverted files and you then discover
        that you shouldn't have done that?<br/>
        If you used TortoiseSVN to revert, you can get the
        reverted changes back again! Because TortoiseSVN
        doesn't just revert your files but first moves them to the Windows
        recycle bin (trash folder).<br/>

        <br/>
        That means your changes aren't lost completely:
        you can find the files in the Windows recycle bin
        and restore them from there.</p>
        <div class="important">
        <h3>This is optional</h3>
        <p>
        Using the recycle bin is optional. In the settings
        dialog under &quot;Dialogs 1&quot; you can disable
        this (it's enabled by default) by unchecking the
        option &quot;Use recycle bin when reverting&quot;
