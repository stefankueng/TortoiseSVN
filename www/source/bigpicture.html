        <h3 id="revisiongraph">Revision graph</h3>
        <p>
        To see the complete history of a file or folder, you can either
        use the log dialog or you can have TortoiseSVN generate a graph
        for you. This graph shows all important (or all, if you really want)
        commits of the selected file/folder.
        </p>
        <a href="/assets/img/RevisionGraph.png" class="fancybox" data-fancybox-group="features" title="Revision Graph">
            <img src="/assets/img/RevisionGraph-small.png" alt="Revision Graph" width="384" height="280">
        </a>
        <p>
        You can export that graph into many different image formats like JPEG/PNG/BMP/...
        or even the vector format WMF.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can also select two entries and compare them. If the item is a folder, you
        can then see all the files which have changed in between the selected revisions.
        If the selected item is a file, you will see both versions of that file side-by-side.
        </p>

        <h3 id="statistics">Statistics</h3>
        <p>
        When you check the log messages of a file or a folder, TortoiseSVN can
        use the information of those commits to create some statistics and graphs
        for you:
        </p>
        <a href="/assets/img/StatsByAuthor.png" class="fancybox" data-fancybox-group="stats" title="Stats By Author">
            <img src="/assets/img/StatsByAuthor-small.png" alt="Stats By Author" width="276" height="199">
        </a>
        <a href="/assets/img/StatsByAuthPie.png" class="fancybox" data-fancybox-group="stats" title="Stats By Auth Pie">
            <img src="/assets/img/StatsByAuthPie-small.png" alt="Stats By Auth Pie" width="276" height="199">
        </a>
        <a href="/assets/img/StatsByWeek.png" class="fancybox" data-fancybox-group="stats" title="Stats By Week">
            <img src="/assets/img/StatsByWeek-small.png" alt="Stats By Week" width="276" height="199">
        </a>

        <h3 id="dirdiff">Comparing tags/branches</h3>
        <p>
        Sometimes you want to see what has changed in between two releases, or what the
        difference is between your branch and the main developing line.
        </p>
        <p>
        There are several places where you can check those differences. One is mentioned
        above in the revision graph. Another is from the repository browser:
        First select the first branch/tag you want to compare, right-click and choose "Mark for comparison".
        Then select the second branch/tag you want to compare, right-click and choose "Compare URLs".
        This will bring up the directory diff dialog:
        </p>
        <a href="/assets/img/DirectoryDiff.png" class="fancybox" data-fancybox-group="none" title="DirectoryDiff">
            <img src="/assets/img/DirectoryDiff-small.png" alt="DirectoryDiff" width="221" height="193">
        </a>
        <p>
        This dialog lists all the files and folders that have changed. Doubleclicking on a file
        will start TortoiseMerge (or whatever diff application you have configured TortoiseSVN
        to use instead) so you can see <strong>exactly</strong> what has changed.
        </p>
