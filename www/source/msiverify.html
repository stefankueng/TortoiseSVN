    <div class="entry">
        <p>Since the TortoiseSVN MSI installer files are hosted on
        many <a href="https://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>
        mirrors, we can't guarantee that they are not modified or
        corrupted when you download them.</p>
        <p>To verify that the files have not been tempered with,
        you can verify the signature of the files yourself. All
        files of TortoiseSVN are digitally signed
        (since version 1.6.3).</p>
        <p>After downloading the files, right-click on the files
        and choose "Properties" from the explorer context menu.
        In the properties dialog, go to the "signatures" tab and
        verify that the file is signed by "Stefan KÃ¼ng" and that
        the signature is valid. If you don't see the "signatures"
        tab, you don't have a good file!</p>

        </a>

        <p>Windows also verifies the signature during installation.
        If the prompt dialog does not say that the signature is
        valid, cancel the installation and download the file
        again!</p>
