                        Sometimes you need to know why a part of your files is the way it
                        is, who made that particular change and why. Or in other words:
                        "Who the h*** put that command there?".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subversion has a command for this, and it is called <em>blame</em>
                        (guess why). Subversion creates a blame of a file by adding information
                        about the author who committed a line, the revision the line was last
                        changed and the date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        TortoiseSVN has its own tool to show you those blames. In addition to
                        the information other Subversion clients show, it also shows you
                        the log message of the commit for each line inside a little tooltip
                        window when you hover the mousepointer over a line.
                    </p>

                        To make it easier to follow a specific revision (which lines exactly
                        were changed in a commit), it colors lines from the same revision
                        differently. Also a separate color is used for the author of the
                        currently selected line.
