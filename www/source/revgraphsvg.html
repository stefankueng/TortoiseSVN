    <div class="entry">
        <p>The revision graph is a nice way to get a quick
        overview of your project. However you can not share
        the graph with other people unless you save it as
        an image and pass the image on.</p>
        <p>If the revision graph is small, then saving the
        graph as a PNG image will do just fine. But as with
        all images, a PNG does not scale very well. And if the
        revision graph is already big the resulting image file
        can get quite big as well. It can even get too big
        to show.</p>
        <p>While you can save the graph as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Metafile">wmf</a>
        file which is much smaller and can scale perfectly, the wmf format
        is Windows only and won't show in e.g. a browser.</p>
        <p>Since TortoiseSVN 1.7 the revision graph can also
        be saved as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG</a>
        file. An SVG file is a vectored format
        which scales perfectly, is relatively small and can
        be shown in all modern browsers.</p>
        <p>To illustrate the problem with big graphs, I saved
        the revision graph of the TortoiseSVN project as a PNG
        file and also as an SVG file.</p>
        <p>The PNG file is 950x8116 pixels and 227 KB
        in size. While the size on disk is not too big, the 8116
        pixels in height are quite big.</p>
        <p>The SVG file however only requires 160 KB on disk
        and can be resized without getting pixelized.</p>
        <p>You can compare the two different formats right
        here in your browser:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="/assets/img/Tortoise-1.7-trunkgraph-full.png">revision graph in PNG format</a></li>
            <li><a href="/assets/img/Tortoise-1.7-trunkgraph-full.svg">revision graph in SVG format</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Try resizing the images in your browser (usually using <kbd>Ctrl+mousewheel</kbd> or
        with <kbd>Ctrl++/-</kbd>). The PNG image gets pixellated real fast, while
        the SVG file scales fine.</p>
