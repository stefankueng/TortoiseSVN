                    <p>The revision graph is a nice way to get a quick
                    overview of your project. However you can not share
                    the graph with other people unless you save it as
                    an image and pass the image on.</p>
                    <p>If the revision graph is small, then saving the
                    graph as a png image will do just fine. But as with
                    all images, a png does not scale very well. And if the
                    revision graph is already big the resulting image file
                    can get quite big as well. It can even get too big
                    to show.</p>
                    <p>While you can save the graph as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Metafile">wmf</a>
                    file which is much smaller and can scale perfectly, the wmf format
                    is Windows only and won't show in e.g. a browser.</p>
                    <p>Since TortoiseSVN 1.7 the revision graph can also
                    be saved as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg">SVG</a>
                    file. An SVG file is a vectored format
                    which scales perfectly, is relatively small and can
                    be shown in all modern browsers.</p>
                    <p>To illustrate the problem with big graphs, I saved
                    the revision graph of the TortoiseSVN project as a png
                    file and also as an SVG file.</p>
                    <p>The png file is 950x8116 pixels and 250kBytes
                    in size. While the size on disk is not too big, the 8116
                    pixels in height are quite big.</p>
                    <p>The SVG file however only requires 161kBytes on disk
                    and can be resized without getting pixelized.</p>
                    <p>You can compare the two different formats right
                    here in your browser:</p>

                    <div class="centered">
                        <a href="/img/Tortoise-1.7-trunkgraph-full.png">revision graph in png format</a>
                    </div>
                    <div class="centered">
                        <a href="/img/Tortoise-1.7-trunkgraph-full.svg">revision graph in SVG format</a>
                    </div>
                    <br/>
                    Try resizing the images in your browser (usually using Ctrl-mousewheel or
                    with Ctrl-+). The png image gets pixellated real fast, while
                    the SVG file scales fine.
