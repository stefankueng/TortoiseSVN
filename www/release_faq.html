	<h2>TortoiseSVN Release FAQ</h2>
</center>
<h2>How often is TortoiseSVN released</h2>

<p>Normally there is a new release of TortoiseSVN every time there is
a new release of Subversion. This means that we are always using the
latest bug-fixed Subversion libraries. Occasionally, if a major bug
is found in TortoiseSVN, there may be an additional release to
fix that.</p>

<h2>Why are the version numbers of Subversion and TortoiseSVN different?</h2>

<p>Because TortoiseSVN is usually released soon after Subversion,
the version numbers are often the same. But they are independent projects
and version numbers are not always aligned.</p>

<h2>Does TortoiseSVN follow the same release procedure as Subversion?</h2>

<p>No. Releases are almost always cut from a tag taken directly from the trunk
rather than using a release branch. This is competely different from the
much more conservative approach taken by the Subversion project.</p>

<p>Subversion provides the access to and management of the version control
database. It is absolutely critical that the Subversion libraries are
well tested and reliable, so they adopt a very careful and controlled
release strategy in order to maximise data safety.</p>

<p>TortoiseSVN is a client which uses the Subversion libraries to do
all the work. If there is a bug in TortoiseSVN it may be inconvenient,
but it should not compromise data safety, so we do not require the
same stringent release procedure. This also allows for much a more
dynamic development process, and less administrative overhead.</p>

<h2>What are Major and Minor releases?</h2>

<p>We define a major release as one which adds significant new
features. Normally this happens when Subversion adds a new
feature, and TSVN grows some new UI to support it.</p>

<p>A minor release includes bugfixes and some new features,
but not large scale changes. There may still be a lot of
small changes.</p>

<h2>How are releases stabilised?</h2>

<p>We have a nightly build site which allows many people to test the
current trunk build. We announce each planned release about a week
beforehand and encourage people to test the nightly builds. During
this testing period, only 'safe' changes are committed to trunk.
This will include bugfixes and doc updates, but no new features.</p>

<p>Before each major release, we normally produce at least one
release candidate (RC) to allow for more extensive testing.
Release Candidates are announced in the same way as full releases
and allow even more people to get on with testing.</p>

<h2>Why don't you use a stabilising branch for releases?</h2>

<p>We did that at one time, but it created a lot of additional
work, and the stability was not noticeably better.
TortoiseSVN is developed by a very much smaller team than
Subversion, and there just aren't enough hours in the day.</p>
