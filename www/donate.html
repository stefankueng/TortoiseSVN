                    You can make a personal donation directly to an individual developer. 
                    We have set up wish lists on Amazon with lots of CD/DVD/books we like:
                    <div class="table">

                    In case you don't know which one of us you want to donate, you can look at some 
                    <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/tortoisesvn/contributors">statistics</a> of the TortoiseSVN project
                    to get an idea how much work each of us does.

                    agreed to the terms and conditions contained in this  notice. Your 
                    donation to the TortoiseSVN project is voluntary and is not a fee for 
                    any services, goods, or advantages, and making a donation to the 
                    TortoiseSVN project does not entitle you to any services, goods,  
                    or advantages.  We have the right to use the money you donate to the

                    corporation nor a registered charity in any country). Your donation may 
                    or may not be tax-deductible; please consult this with your tax advisor. 
                    We will not publish/disclose your name and  e-mail address without your 
                    consent, unless required by applicable law. Your donation is 
                    non-refundable.</span> <br>
