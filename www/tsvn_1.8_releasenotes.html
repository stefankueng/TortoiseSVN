                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.8 is a superset of all previous TortoiseSVN releases,
                and is considered the current stable and "best" release. Anything in
                earlier versions is also in 1.8, but 1.8 contains features and
                bugfixes not present in any earlier release.</p>

                <p>This page describes only major changes. For a complete list
                of changes, you can check our
                <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/source/list">commit logs</a>
                and the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/issues/list?can=1&amp;q=label%3AMilestone-1.8.0">list of issues</a> for 1.8</p>

                <p>Don't forget to check out all the changes in the Subversion
                library that also is now at version 1.8: all those changes
                are of course in TortoiseSVN as well. See the full list
                of changes in the <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.8.html">Subversion 1.8 release notes</a>.</p>

                <h2>Coloring for TortoiseBlame</h2>

                <p>Instead of just coloring the changes by age/revision,
                TortoiseBlame can now color the lines by author so it's easier
                to spot who changed which lines.</p>

                <h2>Commit only parts of a file</h2>
                <p>When working on a task, it often happens that you find
                an issue with the surrounding code. Fixing that issue
                leads then to multiple tasks done in the same file,
                and therefore also to have multiple fixes/tasks done
                in one single commit.</p>
                <p>To commit only the parts of the file that relate
                to one specific issue:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>in the commit dialog, right-click on file, choose "restore after commit"</li>
                    <li>edit the file in e.g. TortoiseMerge: undo the changes that you don't want to commit yet</li>
                    <li>save the file</li>
                    <li>commit the file</li>
                </ol>
                <p>After the commit is done, the original file is restored, containing
                all the changes you didn't commit yet.

                <h2>TortoiseMerge</h2>
                <p>TortoiseMerge, the visual diff/merge tool that comes
                with TortoiseSVN has also a lot of improvements.</p>

                    <dd>TortoiseMerge uses now a Ribbon instead of a plain
                    toolbar for its commands.</dd>
                    <dt>Searching</dt>
                    <dd>new shortcuts to search (Ctrl+F3), better indication of search matches, only search the active view.</dd>

                    <dd>a new command to go to a specific line number.</dd>

                    <dt>handling of UTF-32 files</dt>
                    <dd>TortoiseMerge can now handle files in UTF-32 encoding as well, and recognizes more EOL formats.</dd>

            <div class="post" id="repobrowser">
                <h2>Repository Browser</h2>
                <p>An often requested feature for the Repository Browser
                was to list all the repositories that are offered via the
                <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.serverconfig.httpd.html#svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra">SVNListParentPath</a>
                directive. This is now possible: point the repository browser
                to the root url and it lists all the repositories.
                </p>
                <a href="img/svnparentpath.png" class="fancybox" rel="gallery" title="SVNListParentPath">

                </a>
                <p>At the bottom of the Repository Browser dialog a summary
                is shown, indicating the number of files and folders and the
                currently shown folder.</p>
                <p>There are also two new buttons to go back and forward,
                like in web browsers.</p>
            </div>  <!-- repobrowser -->

            <div class="post" id="extlibs">
                <h2>Third party libraries</h2>
                <p>When there are third party libraries stored in the
                working copy directly, i.e., not via the <em>svn:externals</em>
                property, then updating those is not quite easy.</p>
                <p>Just copying over the new version will work of course, but
                if the new version has files removed, those files will still
                be in your working copy.</p>
                <p>In version 1.8 TortoiseSVN offers an easier way to do this:
                just right-drag the folder with the new version of the library
                to the version stored in your working copy, then select
                <em>SVN vendor branch here</em> from the context menu.</p>
                <p>TortoiseSVN then scans both directories, copies all
                new files, removes files that are not present anymore in the new
                version.</p>
                <p>After TortoiseSVN updated the folder, all you have to
                do is commit the new version.</p>
            </div>  <!-- extlibs -->

            <div class="post" id="progdlg">
                <h2>Progress dialog</h2>
                <p>The dialog that shows the progress of various operations
                now has a better indication of sections/grouping, for example
                when updating a working copy that has multiple externals set.</p>
                <p>Each section/group is indicated by the first line shown in bold.</p>
                <p>And as for updating externals: only those externals that pull
                down modifications are shown in the dialog. If an external hasn't
                changed then the dialog does not show any information for it.
                This reduces the no-information lines a lot, especially if you
                have a lot of externals set.</p>

            <div class="post" id="subwcrev">
                <h2>SubWCRev</h2>
                <p>SubWCRev also got a lot of improvements, the major ones are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Files in UTF-16 encoding can be used as well, either as
                    sources/templates or as target files as well.</li>
                    <li>A new option to specify an offset for the working copy revision.
                    This is required in case your repository is at revisions > 65535 and
                    you want to use the revision for the version resource: the Windows
                    version resource numbers are only 16-bit, and in this situation
                    you can specify a negative offset so the version resource number
                    is below that 16-bit limit.</li>
                    <li>SubWCRev can detect unversioned files and/or folders. This
                    is useful in case you want an error returned in your build in case
                    you have such unversioned items in your working copy, indicating that you
                    may have missed to add and commit those items.</li>

            </div>  <!-- subwcrev -->

            <div class="post" id="customprops">
                <h2>Custom properties</h2>
                <p>If you're using custom properties, you can now configure TortoiseSVN
                to provide better dialogs to edit and modify them.</p>
                <p>The properties <em>tsvn:userfileproperties</em> and <em> tsvn:userdirproperties</em>
                got extended so you can specify what kind of property you have.</p>

            <div class="post" id="clienthook">
                <h2>Client hook scripts configurable via properties</h2>
                <p>In earlier versions you could only configure client-side
                hook scripts via the settings dialog. This worked ok if you
                only had a few workstations/users to configure. But if you
                wanted a big team of committers to all run the hook scripts
                you needed, this required a lot of work to set up.</p>
                <p>In TortoiseSVN 1.8 you can now configure the hook scripts
                to run via project properties.</p>
                <p>To avoid running potentially insecure scripts without the user
                knowing it, TortoiseSVN will ask to run those scripts first.</p>
                <p>Have a look at our
                <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-propertypage.html#tsvn-dug-propertypage-tsvn-props">docs</a>

                <h2>Compatibility concerns</h2>

                <h3>Local Client Compatibility</h3>
                <p>Subversion working copies are sometimes accessed using
                several different clients, e.g. TortoiseSVN, AnkhSVN,
                and the svn command line client. Because the working copy format
                has changed with this release, 1.8 clients cannot access an earlier
                working copy without first upgrading it. Pre-1.8 clients cannot access
                1.8 working copies at all and there is no downgrade option.
                </p>
                <p>Migrating to 1.8 working copies must be considered a one-way
                operation. If you need to use multiple clients on the same working
                copy then be sure that you can update all the clients before upgrading
                the working copy.
                </p>

                <h3>Client Server Compatibility</h3>
                <p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.8
                servers and clients.  That is to say, you can use a 1.8 client with
                an older server, and you can use a 1.8 server with older clients.
                However, some of the new 1.8 features may
                not be available unless both client and server are the latest
                version.  There are also cases where a new feature will work
                but will run less efficiently if the client is new and the
                server old.</p>

                <h3>Log Dialog enhancements to help with code reviews</h3>
                <p>
                    A new context menu &#39;Create code collaborator review&#39; has been added to
                    provide interoperability with the SmartBear Code Collaborator review tool.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two new context menus and commands have been added to the log dialog when
                    multiple files are selected in the bottom 'files changed' listbox.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Show multiple changes...</li>
                    <li>Open multiple local...</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The details of how these commands work, which include special support for
                    loading working copy files into Visual Studio can be found in the subversion
                    help file under the topic 'Invoking the Revision Log Dialog'.
