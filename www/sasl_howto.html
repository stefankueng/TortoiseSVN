            <h3>What is SASL?</h3>
            <p>
                The Cyrus Simple Authentication and Security Layer is
                open source software written by Carnegie Mellon University.
                It adds generic authentication and encryption capabilities
                to any network protocol, and as of Subversion 1.5 and later,
                both the svnserve server and TortoiseSVN client know how to
                make use of this library.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a more complete discussion of the options available, you should
                look at the Subversion book in the section
                <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.serverconfig.svnserve.html#svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sasl">Using svnserve with SASL</a>.
                If you are just looking for a simple way to set up secure
                authentication and encryption on a Windows server, so that your
                repository can be accessed safely over the big bad Internet,
                read on.
            </p>
            <h3>SASL Authentication</h3>
            <p>
                To activate specific SASL mechanisms on the server, you'll
                need to do three things. First, create a <code>[sasl]</code>
                section in your repository's <cite>svnserve.conf</cite>
                file, with this key-value pair:
            </p>
<pre>
use-sasl = true
</pre>
            <p>
                Second, create a file called <cite>svn.conf</cite> in a
                convenient location - typically in the directory where subversion
                is installed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thirdly, create two new registry entries to tell SASL where to
                find things. Create a registry key named
            </p>
<pre>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Carnegie Mellon\Project Cyrus\SASL Library]
</pre>
            <p>
                and place two new string values inside it:
                <code>SearchPath</code> set to the directory path containing
                the <cite>sasl*.dll</cite> plug-ins (normally in the
                Subversion install directory), and <code>ConfFile</code> set
                to the directory containing the <cite>svn.conf</cite> file.
                If you used the CollabNet installer, these registry keys will already
                have been created for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Edit the <cite>svn.conf</cite> file to contain the following:
            </p>
<pre>
pwcheck_method: auxprop
auxprop_plugin: sasldb
mech_list: DIGEST-MD5
sasldb_path: C:\TortoiseSVN\sasldb</pre>
            <p>
                The last line shows the location of the authentication database,
                which is a file called <cite>sasldb</cite>.
                This could go anywhere, but a convenient choice is the repository
                parent path. Make sure that the svnserve service has read access
                to this file.
            </p>
            <p>
                If svnserve was already running, you will need to restart it to
                ensure it reads the updated configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that everything is set up, all you need to do is create some
                users and passwords. To do this you need the
                <code>saslpasswd2</code> program. If you used the CollabNet
                installer, that program will be in the install directory.
                Use a command something like this:
            </p>
<pre>
saslpasswd2 -c -f C:\TortoiseSVN\sasldb -u realm username
</pre>
            <p>
                The <code>-f</code> switch gives the database location,
                <code>realm</code> must be the same as the value you
                defined in your repository's <cite>svnserve.conf</cite>
                file, and username is exactly what you expect it to be.
                Note that the realm is not allowed to contain space characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can list the usernames stored in the database using the
                <code>sasldblistusers2</code> program.
            </p>
            <h3>SASL Encryption</h3>
            <p>
                To enable or disable different levels of encryption, you can
                set two values in your repository's
                <cite>svnserve.conf</cite> file:
            </p>
<pre>
[sasl]
use-sasl = true
min-encryption = 128
max-encryption = 256</pre>
            <p>
                The <code>min-encryption</code> and
                <code>max-encryption</code> variables control the
                level of encryption demanded by the server. To disable
                encryption completely, set both values to 0. To enable
                simple checksumming of data (i.e., prevent tampering and
                guarantee data integrity without encryption), set both
                values to 1. If you wish to allow (but not require) encryption,
                set the minimum value to 0, and the maximum value to some
                bit-length. To require encryption unconditionally, set both
                values to numbers greater than 1. In our previous example,
                we require clients to do at least 128-bit encryption,
                but no more than 256-bit encryption.
