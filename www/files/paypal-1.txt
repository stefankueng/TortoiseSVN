Dear Stefan Kueng,

We appreciate your interest in PayPal.   However, due to legal and
regulatory constraints, PayPal Private Limited is unable to process
payments for non-registered charities and non-profit organizations (NPOs),
political party/organizations, religious institutions,
personal/organizational fundraisers, etc. in countries under its
jurisdiction.  You may refer to the PayPal Private Limited User Agreement
link (https://www.paypal.com/sg/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/ua-outside) to
review the list of countries under its jurisdiction.

This is not a decision we make lightly, and we deeply regret any
inconvenience or frustration this matter may cause you.  Please understand
that this decision is final.

If you have any questions, you may contact us at apacdd@paypal.com.

Sincerely,
Jaclyn
PayPal Compliance Department
PayPal, an eBay Company
