                <h2>What's New in TortoiseSVN 1.4</h2>

                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.4 is a superset of all previous TortoiseSVN releases.
                Anything in 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 1.2.x or 1.3.x is also in 1.4, but 1.4 contains
                features and bugfixes not present in any earlier release. It is
                linked with Subversion 1.4.</p>

                <ul>
                   <li><p>Action dialogs (commit/check for modification/add...)</p>
                       <p>
                       <ul>
                       <li>
                       "Compare with BASE" is now possible for added and deleted files too.
                       The diff viewer will show the diff against an empty file in that case.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                       The columns shown are configurable. You can choose which columns are
                       shown and what sizes they have. The configuration is saved between
                       sessions.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                       The 'OK' button is disabled until at least one file/folder is selected
                       to avoid empty operations.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                       Files and folders shown can be dragged to other applications. Also files and
                       folder can be dragged from the explorer on to those dialogs.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                       The dialogs can be interrupted while the status is fetched by clicking on 'Cancel'.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                       Switched files/folders are indicated with an '(s)' after the status text.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                       Subversion properties can be edited/set/deleted directly from these dialogs with
                       a right-click.
                       </li>
                       </ul>
                       </p>
                   </li>
                   <li><p>Log dialog</p>
                       <p>
                       <ul>
                       <li>
                       New column showing the bugtraq ID string assigned to the revision.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                       You can now specify a range for which the log messages should be fetched
                       to avoid having to either click on 'Next 100' repeatedly or fetch all
                       messages at once.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                       The log messages can contain simple formatting. You can write text in <strong>*bold*</strong>, <em>^italic^</em>
                       or <u>_underlined_</u>. Of course, the formatting is also done in the commit dialog while you are
                       writing the log message.
                       </li>
                       </ul>
                       </p>
                   </li>
                <p>
                </p>
                   <li><p>Explorer</p>
                       <p>
                       <ul>
                       <li>
                       The context menu shows different icons depending on what entry the menu is
                       for. If you right-click on a shortcut, two entries are shown, one with a link icon
                       and one with a folder or file icon (depending on what the shortcut points to).
                       If you right-click on a file, again two entries are shown. One with a file icon for
                       the file itself, and one with a folder icon for the parent folder.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                       New "Move and rename" entry in the context menu.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                       New column for showing the svn:eol-style property.
                       </li>
                       </ul>
                       </p>

                    <li><p>Revision graph</p>
                        <p>
                        The Revision graph got some major improvements. It has been rewritten
                        almost completely to address some issues users reported in the past.
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                        Analyzing the data is much faster.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Ability to show all revisions, not just the ones where there was a copy
                        operation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Ability to have the graph sort the nodes by path.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Better zooming support.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                        When dragging items, folders are opened and closed automatically
                        if hoovering over them for more than two seconds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Dragging items beyond the visible area makes the browser scroll the
                        view automatically.

                        <li>
                        An option to disable the cache process completely and either fetch the status
                        only for the currently visible folder or not show any overlays at all.

                        Changes inside lines are colored differently to better see what exactly has
                        changed.

                        <li>
                        Changed blocks which have only changed in whitespace are marked with a white
                        circle. Such changes usually happen due to code cleanups and have no functional
                        changes. Now those blocks are clearly marked so you can easily go over them.

                        This is a new tool which shows two images side-by-side. If you have images in
                        your working copy (e.g. screenshots or partial screenshots for the helpfile/documentation)
                        then you can now easily compare the new version of the image with the old one.
                        This tool is for images what TortoiseMerge is for text files.

                        <p>
                        Due to a new function available in the Subversion 1.4 library, comparing
                        two branches/tags is now much faster and reliable. Also it's now immediately clear
                        if the file or property contents were changed.

                <h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

                <p>
                Subversion 1.4 uses a new format for the working copy. The update is
                done automatically, you won't even notice it. But once the working copy
                has been updated, you won't be able to access it with clients linked
                to older versions of the Subversion library.
                </p>
                <p>Due to the upgrade process to the new working copy format, you might
                run into slight problems with the overlays not showing up or not showing
                the correct status. Just run <em>update</em> or <em>cleanup</em> on
                your working copy to get the overlay icons back to normal.
                </p>

                <p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.4
                servers and clients.  Of course, some of the new 1.4 features may not
                be available unless both client and server are the latest version.
                There is <strong>no need</strong> to upgrade your repositories;
                </p>

                <p>If you access a BDB repository using <code>file://</code> access
                you will need to update that repository to BDB 4.3 format. But this is
                only necessary if you're upgrading from a TortoiseSVN version before
                1.2.
                Instructions on how to do that can be found on the
                <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#bdb43-upgrade">
