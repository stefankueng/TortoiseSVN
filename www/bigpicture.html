                    <h3>Revision graph</h3>
                    <p>
                    To see the complete history of a file or folder, you can either
                    use the log dialog or you can have TortoiseSVN generate a graph
                    for you. This graph shows all important (or all, if you really want)
                    commits of the selected file/folder.
                    </p>
                    <a href="img/RevisionGraph.png" class="fancybox" rel="features" title="Revision Graph">
                        <img src="img/RevisionGraph-small.png" alt="Revision Graph" width="384" height="280"/>
                    </a>
                    <p>
                    You can export that graph into many different image formats like jpeg/png/bmp/...
                    or even the vector format wmf.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    You can also select two entries and compare them. If the item is a folder, you
                    can then see all the files which have changed in between the selected revisions.
                    If the selected item is a file, you will see both versions of that file side-by-side.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Statistics</h3>
                    <p>
                    When you check the log messages of a file or a folder, TortoiseSVN can
                    use the information of those commits to create some statistics and graphs
                    for you:
                    </p>
                    <a href="img/StatsByAuthor.png" class="fancybox" rel="stats" title="Stats By Author">
                        <img src="img/StatsByAuthor-small.png" alt="Stats By Author" width="276" height="199"/>
                    </a>
                    <a href="img/StatsByAuthPie.png" class="fancybox" rel="stats" title="Stats By Auth Pie">
                        <img src="img/StatsByAuthPie-small.png" alt="Stats By Auth Pie" width="276" height="199"/>
                    </a>
                    <a href="img/StatsByWeek.png" class="fancybox" rel="stats" title="Stats By Week">
                        <img src="img/StatsByWeek-small.png" alt="Stats By Week" width="276" height="199"/>
                    </a>

                    <h3>Comparing tags/branches</h3>
                    <p>
                    Sometimes you want to see what has changed in between two releases, or what the
                    difference is between your branch and the main developing line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    There are several places where you can check those differences. One is mentioned
                    above in the revision graph. Another is from the repository browser:
                    First select the first branch/tag you want to compare, right-click and choose "Mark for comparison".
                    Then select the second branch/tag you want to compare, right-click and choose "Compare URLs".
                    This will bring up the directory diff dialog:
                    </p>
                    <a href="img/DirectoryDiff.png" class="fancybox" rel="none" title=""><img src="img/DirectoryDiff-small.png" alt="" width="" height=""/></a>
                    <p>
                    This dialog lists all the files and folders that have changed. Doubleclicking on a file
                    will start TortoiseMerge (or whatever diff application you have configured TortoiseSVN
                    to use instead) so you can see <strong>exactly</strong> what has changed.
                    </p>
