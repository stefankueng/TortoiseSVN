                <div class="entry">
                    <p>Some of you may have noticed that the last two versions
                    of TortoiseSVN did not always install properly if an older
                    version was already installed. To fix the problem, all you
                    needed to do was to run the installer again and choose
                    "Repair" in the dialog.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the next version (supposed to be 1.6.10)
                    will have the very same problem. I'm sorry about that. But
                    the versions after that should work fine again. That means
                    an update from any version to version 1.6.10 or later will
                    require a repair install!</p>

                    <p>If you want to know more about the technical details of
                    the problem, read on. If not, just remember that all you
                    have to do is to run the installer again and choose
                    "Repair".</p>

                    <p>Now the technical details:</p>
                    <p>TortoiseSVN uses <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/">WiX</a>
                    to create the msi installer. MSI has a built in mechanism
                    for upgrading packages. In TortoiseSVN, we always use
                    the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa370579%28VS.85%29.aspx">major upgrade</a>.</p>

                    <p>Msi groups files/registry entries/settings/... which are
                    to be installed into <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa368007%28VS.85%29.aspx">components</a>.
                    Each component then contains the files/registry entries/...
                    to install. It either installs everything that's grouped
                    into a component or nothing. Installing only part of a
                    component is not possible. Of course, that also applies for
                    upgrades: either the whole component is upgraded or the
                    whole component is left unchanged.</p>

                    <p>When upgrading, TortoiseSVN also schedules the
                    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa371197%28VS.85%29.aspx">RemoveExistingProducts</a>
                    action right after the InstallFinalize action. This is to
                    make sure that even when upgrading, nothing old and unused
                    is left lying around.</p>

                    <p>When upgrading, msi doesn't just upgrade unconditionally
                    but first checks whether a component actually needs upgrading.
                    To help msi check whether an upgrade is necessary, each component
                    has a <a href="http://robmensching.com/blog/posts/2003/10/4/Windows-Installer-Components-Introduction">keypath</a>.
                    A keypath is usually a file or a registry key. In case of a
                    file, msi uses the file's version info and/or the filedate
                    to determine whether to upgrade or not and whether the
                    component is already installed or not. If the keypath points
                    to a registry key, msi can only determine whether the
                    component is already installed or not, since a registry key
                    has no version info and no date.</p>

                    <p>In Version 1.6.8 of TortoiseSVN, we changed the values
                    and names of some registry keys that are used for the icon
                    overlays. We had all those registry entries placed into a
                    separate component, so that component only had registry
                    entries and no files. That of course also means that the
                    keypath of that component is a registry key.</p>
                    <p>Now here's what happened when you upgraded to version 1.6.8:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>msi starts</li>
                        <li>it detects the older version and all old components,
                        also whether a component needs updating or not. </li>
                        <li>msi installs the new version. All components that
                        need upgrading are upgraded/installed. And here's the
                        problem: components that have a registry key as the
                        keypath are not upgraded if that keypath already exists!</li>
                        <li>After the installation of the new components is done,
                        msi removes all old components. Of course, the
                        components that were upgraded are not removed since
                        they are now newer than the one it has to remove.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>As you can see, the problem with version 1.6.8 was in
                    step 3. The old component was left in place in the upgrade.
                    Doing a repair install forces msi to reinstall all components
                    in step 3, so that fixed the problem.</p>
                    <p>So I thought to fix the problem in our msi, scheduling
                    the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa371197%28VS.85%29.aspx">RemoveExistingProducts</a>
                    action after the InstallValidate action was all that's
                    needed. Which leads to the following install steps in
                    version 1.6.9:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>msi starts</li>
                        <li>it detects the older version and all old components,
                        also whether a component needs updating or not. </li>
                        <li>msi removes all components of the previous version</li>
                        <li>msi installs the new version. All components are
                        installed since the older components were just removed.
                        So even components that have a registry key as the
                        keypath get properly upgraded.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>So everything's fine, right? As it turned out: not so
                    much. Unfortunately there's a problem when using components
                    that get installed in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa376307%28VS.85%29.aspx">SxS</a>
                    cache. TortoiseSVN uses the C-runtime and MFC components of
                    Visual Studio which happen to be such components, the
                    problem described in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/905238">kb905238</a>
                    happened. It's a long read but worth it if you're interested.
                    Short version: such components get removed but not installed
                    again, so they're missing after the installation.</p>
                    <p>Of course, as with the problem with the 1.6.8 version, a
                    repair install was all you had to do to get TortoiseSVN
                    installed and running correctly again.</p>
                    <p>As it seems, there is no solution that really works.</p>
                    <p>The only way we can get an installer that works properly
                    when upgrading, i.e., upgrades all components reliably even
                    if we just change registry entries is to <strong>not</strong> use
                    registry keys as the keypath of components.</p>

                    <p>So that's what I did now: I moved all registry entries
                    to components that have a file as the keypath, and a file
                    that has version info. That way, msi detects the version
                    and always installs the new version. And of course I've
                    rescheduled the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa371197%28VS.85%29.aspx">RemoveExistingProducts</a>
                    action to run after the InstallFinalize action to avoid the
                    problem described in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/905238">kb905238</a>.
                    So after you've installed the next version of TortoiseSVN
                    (will be version 1.6.10), upgrading to newer versions
                    (>= 1.6.11) should work properly again.</p>
                    <p>But of course: upgrading to 1.6.10 from any previous
                    version will have the same problem as version 1.6.8 had.
                    That's because the components that installed only the
                    registry entries are installed in step 3 properly since
                    they're now part of a component with a file path as the
                    keypath, but then the old components are removed in step 4.
                    And because the old components had the same registry
                    entries as were installed in step 3, they're gone now.</p>
                    <p>To sum up: the problems we have were due to my mistake
                    of using registry keys as keypaths for components. There's
                    no way to fix this in msi so that upgrades from older
                    versions (which had this mistake built in) work. But it
                    will work again properly for upgrades with versions that
                    don't have that mistake anymore. That means once you have
                    1.6.10 installed, upgrades to higher versions will work
                    again properly.</p>
                    <h2>Update:</h2>
                    <p>Ivan Zhakov <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=757&amp;dsMessageId=2646381">suggested</a>
                    a solution that could have worked better: mark the
                    registry-only components to use the parent folder as the
                    keypath. To do this just add KeyPath='yes' to the Component
                    element and remove KeyPath='yes' from the RegistryKey
                    element.</p>
