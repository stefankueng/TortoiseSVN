                    <h2>A little bit of history</h2>
                    <p>
                    TortoiseSVN has used its own crash handler since the very first release.
                    If TortoiseSVN crashed for any reason, a dialog is shown which
                    allowed you to send the crash dump to us. We then analyze
                    those crashes and fix whatever caused them. This helped us
                    to make TortoiseSVN much more stable (stop laughing, it could be worse!).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For a long time, sending the crash dumps to us only worked
                    via email. With Version 1.7.6 that changed: we started
                    using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/crashrpt/">crashrpt</a> which allows to send
                    the reports via http.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    While before 1.7.6 we got maybe 4-8 reports a day, now
                    that changed to +100 reports per day! I guess that
                    most of you either only used web mail or didn't wanted
                    to send the reports from your email account. With the
                    http send, this isn't an issue anymore and that's why
                    we now get so many reports.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As you can imagine, it's simply not possible to analyze
                    that many reports manually anymore. So as of version 1.7.7
                    we're switching our crash reporter once again. But
                    not back to an email-sending one, but one that offers
                    a lot more features: <a href="http://www.crash-server.com">crash-server.com</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h2>crash-server.com</h2>
                    <p>
                    The crash handler from <a href="http://www.crash-server.com">crash-server.com</a> is
                    not just a client side handler, but offers automatic
                    analysis on the server side as well.
                    All reports that are caused by the same crash are
                    automatically grouped together, so we only have
                    to analyze the best dump file of a crash instead of
                    every single one. Without this, there's no way we
                    could handle all the reports we now get!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Also instead of only sending a
                    <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680369.aspx">minidump</a>,
                    it can send us a full dump if the crash hasn't been
                    previously reported. We also can ask for a full dump
                    in case the minidump we have does not provide enough
                    information to fix the problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Another nice feature is that after you've sent
                    the crash report and the problem you're experiencing
                    has already been fixed, you're automatically forwarded
                    to the corresponding page in our issue tracker.
                    There you can find out more about your problem and
                    decide for yourself if you want to download a
                    <a href="http://nightlybuilds.tortoisesvn.net/">nightly build</a> or not.

                    <a href="http://www.crash-server.com">crash-server.com</a> is available for
                    free for open source projects. Pricing for commercial
                    projects is shown <a href="http://www.crash-server.com/Pricing.aspx">here</a>. If you want
                    to find out more about how this works, there is a
                    nice <a href="https://www.crash-server.com/Demo/Demo.aspx">video</a> available that explains
                    the basics, a <a href="http://www.crash-server.com/Demo/MiniDumpWriteDump.aspx">more detailed
                    description</a> and a tutorial on how to <a href="http://www.crash-server.com/Integration.aspx">integrate</a> it
                    into your own application.

                    <h2>Always send the reports</h2>
                    <p>
                    With so many crash reports we get, we simply don't
                    have the time to analyze every single one of them and
                    that's why we rely on the grouping of the reports
                    on <a href="http://www.crash-server.com">crash-server.com</a>. Every sent
                    report is first automatically analyzed and if the
                    same crash was already reported before moved to
                    the corresponding problem. That problem then has
                    its crash count increased.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As you can imagine, we try to fix the problems with
                    the highest crash count first. If you encounter a
                    crash, then please send the report. It will increase
                    the crash count of the problem and therefore also
                    increase the priority for us to fix it.
                    </p>

                    </a>
                    <p>
                    Even if you've sent the report before, please send
                    it again if the crash happens again. Because it might
                    not be the same problem even if it appears to be.
                    And if it is, then it will increase the priority of the problem.
