<!-- The class h2 is included on the main div, because the HTML which the
     server will wrap around the page includes a <div class="h2">.
     Thus, we include one here so that the page looks right when previewed
     locally, *but* we override the border which the CSS assigns to that
     style, so that we do not get two borders on the live page. -->

	<h2>TortoiseIDiff</h2>
	<p>
		Depending on your project, not all files which are under version
		control are text files. Most likely you will have images too, for
		example screenshots and diagrams for the documentation/helpfile.
	</p>
	<p>
		For those files it's not possible to use a common file diff tool,
		because they only work with text files and diff line-by-line.
		Here is where the Tortoise Image Diff tool (TortoiseIDiff) comes
		to the rescue. It can show two images side-by-side, or even
		show the images over each other alpha blended.
