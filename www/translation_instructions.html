                    <p>TortoiseSVN is still in development so the translation
                    of all resources is also a work 'in progress'.</p>

                    <h3>General</h3>
                    <p>The TortoiseSVN project uses gettext PO (portable object)
                    files for its translation. PO files are plain text, so you
                    can even translate using a normal text editor. The only
                    thing you have to take care of is that the editor can handle
                    the UTF-8 charset. There is a wide range of tools out there
                    that can handle and manipulate PO files.</p>

                    <p>We recommend that you use
                    <a href="http://poedit.sourceforge.net">poEdit</a> or
                    <a href="http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/virtaal/index">Virtaal</a>
                    on Windows.</p>

                    <p>This description assumes that you use poEdit.</p>

                    <h3>Getting started</h3>
                    <p>If you want to implement a new language for TortoiseSVN
                    do the following.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Use TortoiseSVN (or any other SubVersion client) to
                        check out:<br/>
                        <a href="https://tortoisesvn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Languages">https://tortoisesvn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Languages</a>
                        (You will get more than one file).</p>
                        <p>Or point your browser to:<br/>
                        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/source/browse/trunk/Languages">http://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/source/browse/trunk/Languages</a>,
                        select <strong>Tortoise.pot</strong> and save this file
                        to your local harddisk. Tortoise.pot is the portable
                        object template (hence .pot) for the translation.
                        </li>
                        <li>Rename Tortoise.pot to Tortoise_xx.po, where xx is
                        your two letter ISO-639-1 language code. Look up your
                        language code here:
                        <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langcodes.html">http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langcodes.html</a>.
                        <p>If you want to translate into a language that has two
                        different locales and you <em>really</em> need the
                        second locale, add the two letter ISO-3166 locale code.
                        If you're not sure about your country code, look here:
                        <a href="http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html">http://www.iso.ch/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-lists/list-en1.html</a>.</p>
                        <p>Please keep in mind that we would like to have as few
                        translations as possible that cover as many languages
                        as possible. We would not be very happy at having to
                        maintain a (de_CH) Swiss German, (de_AT) Austrian German
                        and (de_DE) German German translation. :-)<br/>
                        But if it's necessary like in Chinese, sure go ahead.
                        We are happy with simplified (zh_CN) and traditional
                        (zh_TW) Chinese.
                        </li>
                        <li>It would also be nice, if you sent us your four
                        digit locale ID along with the file. The list of locale
                        IDs as defined by Microsoft can be found here:
                        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/lcid-all.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/lcid-all.mspx</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>Now translate what you can using poEdit. If you are
                        not sure with one or the other translation, mark it
                        as <em>fuzzy</em>. You can enter a comment in poEdit to
                        give some information about your thoughts to other
                        translators.<br/>

                        If you are not sure about the meaning of the original
                        sentence ask on the list.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add a header with '#' comments to the PO file using
                        a normal text editor that explains which language you
                        translated and the terminology you used, like:<br/>
                        <code><br/>
                           #<br/>
                           # German translations for TortoiseSVN<br/>
                           # This file is distributed under the same license as the subversion package.<br/>
                           #<br/>

                           # Translation dictionary:<br/>
                           #<br/>
                           # argument    parameter<br/>
                           # bogus      ungültig<br/>
                           # checkout    auschecken (denglisch, ich weiss, aber akzeptabel)<br/>
                           # client    Client, des Client<br/>

                           # commit    Übertragen<br/>
                           # item        Objekt<br/>
                           # label      Marke / Markierung<br/>
                        </code>
                        </li>
                        <li>Make sure your file is saved in UTF-8 encoding and
                        that it does <strong>not</strong> begin with UTF-8 BOMs
                        (Byte Order Marks)
                        </li>
                        <li>Send your Tortoise_xx.po to the mailing list
                        (translators@tortoisesvn.tigris.org) or, if you have a
                        <a href="http://code.google.com">Google Code account</a>,
                        request commit access  to the project via the translators
                        mailing list, you may commit your translations directly
                        into the TortoiseSVN repository.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Adding to an existing translation</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Get hold of Tortoise.pot and the Tortoise_xx.po you
                        want to improve
                        </li>
                        <li>Start poEdit with Tortoise_xx.po and select
                        <cite>Update from .pot file</cite> from the "Catalog" Menu
                        </li>
                        <li>Select Tortoise.pot and wait until poEdit has
                        finished merging the template and the current translation.
                        </li>
                        <li>The untranslated strings (and fuzzy translations)
                        are always at the top of the list.
                        </li>
                        <li>Translate what you can and send the resulting PO
                        file back to the mailing list (translators@tortoisesvn.tigris.org).
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Important</h3>
                    <p>Please pay special attention to cases where placeholders
                    for variables like "%s" or "%d" appear in the original text.
                    They have to appear in in the translation again. If the
                    parameters are numbered, like "%1!s! files copied to %2!s!",
                    you may reverse the order in your translation if you need
                    to do so to form a proper phrase in your language.</p>
                    <p>We have a very nice consistency checker for translations
                    at <a href="http://tsvn.e-posta.sk" rel="nofollow">http://tsvn.e-posta.sk</a>.
                    This tool highlights cases where it thinks there may be a
                    problem.</p>

                    <h3>What now?</h3>
                    <p>That's all you have to do. We'll take care of creating
                    the resource dlls and installers for the different
                    language packs.</p>

                    <h3>Testing your translation</h3>
                    <p>If you want to test the translations you made yourself,
                    just wait for the next
                    <a href="http://nightlybuilds.tortoisesvn.net/">nightly build</a>.<br/>

                    The nightly build is done every night at 0:00 GMT+1. The
                    Language Packs however are only built twice a week (on
                    Sunday and Wednesday).
                    The whole build takes about an hour. After the build is done,
                    the installers (including the language packs) are uploaded
                    for you to use.</p>
