<h2>What's New in TortoiseSVN 1.6</h2>

</ul>

<p>TortoiseSVN 1.6 is a superset of all previous TortoiseSVN releases,
and is considered the current stable and "best" release. Anything in 1.0.x,
1.1.x, 1.2.x, 1.3.x, 1.4.x or 1.5.x is also in 1.6, but 1.6 contains features and
bugfixes not present in any earlier release.</p>

<div class="h2" id="compatibility" title="compatibility">
<h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.6
servers and clients.  However, some of the new 1.6 features (e.g., <a
href="#XXX" >XXX</a>) may not be available
unless both client and server are the latest version .  There are also
cases (e.g., <a href="#XXX">XXX</a>) where a
new feature will work but will run less efficiently if the client is
new and the server old.</p>

<h3>Working Copy and Repository Filesystem Format Changes</h3>

<p>The working copy format has been upgraded.  This means that 1.5 and
older Subversion clients will <em>not</em> be able to work with
working copies produced by Subversion/TortoiseSVN 1.6.  Working copies are <a
href="#wc-upgrades" >upgraded automatically</a>.</p>

<div class="h4" id="wc-upgrades" title="wc-upgrades">
<h4>Working Copy Upgrades</h4>

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> if a Subversion 1.6 client encounters a
pre-1.6 working copy, it will <em>automatically</em> upgrade the
working copy format as soon as it touches it, making it unreadable by
older Subversion clients.  If you are using several versions of
Subversion on your machine, be careful about which version you use in
which working copy, to avoid accidentally upgrading a working copy.
(But note that this "auto upgrade" behavior does <em>not</em> occur
with the <a href="#repos-upgrades" >repositories</a>, only working
copies.)</p>

<p>If you accidentally upgrade a 1.5 working copy to 1.6, and wish to
downgrade back to 1.5, use the <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/tools/client-side/change-svn-wc-format.py"
><tt>change-svn-wc-format.py</tt></a> script.  See <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#working-copy-format-change"
>this FAQ entry</a> for details, and run the script with the
<code>--help</code> option for usage instructions.</p>

<h3>Improved handling of tree conflicts (<em>client</em>)</h3>

<p>Improved handling of tree conflicts.</p>

</div>  <!-- tree-conflicts -->

<div class="h2" id="log-cache" title="Log Cache">
<h2>Log Cache</h2>

<p>The log cache introduced in TortoiseSVN 1.5 has been improved. It can
now work better with repositories that have the same UUID.</p>

<p>Also, the "Ambiguous url" option no longer limits the functionality of
the log cache.</p>

</div>  <!-- log-cache -->

<div class="h2" id="revision-graph" title="revision-graph">
<h2>Revision Graph</h2>

<p>The revision graph has changed dramatically and has been rewritten almost
completely.</p>

<p>The new revision graph has much more options to tweak the output. For example,
it is now possible to hide/show individual subtrees.
