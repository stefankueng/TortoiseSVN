                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.6 is a superset of all previous TortoiseSVN releases,
                and is considered the current stable and "best" release. Anything in earlier versions
                is also in 1.6, but 1.6 contains features and
                bugfixes not present in any earlier release.</p>

                <h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

                <p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.6
                servers and clients.  However, some of the new 1.6 features may not be available
                unless both client and server are the latest version.  There are also
                cases where a new feature will work but will run less efficiently if the client is
                new and the server old.</p>

                    <h3>Working Copy and Repository Filesystem Format Changes</h3>

                    <p>The working copy format has been upgraded.  This means that 1.5 and
                    older Subversion clients will <em>not</em> be able to work with
                    working copies produced by Subversion/TortoiseSVN 1.6.  Working copies are <a
                    href="#wc-upgrades">upgraded automatically</a>.</p>

                    <div class="h4" id="wc-upgrades">
                    <h4>Working Copy Upgrades</h4>

                    <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> if a Subversion 1.6 client encounters a
                    pre-1.6 working copy, it will <em>automatically</em> upgrade the
                    working copy format as soon as it touches it, making it unreadable by
                    older Subversion clients.  If you are using several versions of
                    Subversion on your machine, be careful about which version you use in
                    which working copy, to avoid accidentally upgrading a working copy.
                    </p>

                    <p>If you accidentally upgrade a 1.5 working copy to 1.6, and wish to
                    downgrade back to 1.5, use the <a

                <h3>file:/// access to BDB repositories</h3>
                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.6 no longer supports access to BDB repositories via the
                file:/// url. This doesn't affect accessing BDB repositories over svn:// or http:// though.</p>
                <p>If you have a BDB repository that you still access via the file:/// url, you
                have to convert the repository to the FSFS format with the
                <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.ref.svnadmin.html">svnadmin</a> tool
                which is available in the <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/getting.html#windows">SVN command line client</a>.</p>
                <p>Please follow the
                <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate">instructions</a>
                in the Subversion book to convert the repository.</p>

                <div class="h3" id="tree-conflicts">
                <h3>Improved handling of tree conflicts</h3>

                <p>Subversion 1.6 can detect tree conflicts during update/merge/switch
                operations. Those items are then marked as conflicted to indicate
                the problem.</p>
                <p>Note that Subversion is still treating renames as a &quot;copy+delete&quot;
                operation, so file renames causing tree conflicts can only be detected
                in terms of file additions and deletions. Because of this, false positives
                during tree conflict detection are possible.</p>
                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.6 shows those tree conflicts during the operation when
                they happen, and also with a conflict overlay and in the Check-for-modifications dialog.</p>
                <p>A new conflict resolve dialog helps with resolving such conflicts, indicating
                the type of tree conflict and hints on how you can resolve those conflicts.</p>

                <div class="h3" id="log-cache">
                <h3>Log Cache</h3>

                <p>The log cache introduced in TortoiseSVN 1.5 has been improved to run
                more smoothly. An extensive set of options is available to control the
                cache management. See the settings dialog for details.</p>

                <p>Also, repositories sharing the same URL or UUID are now fully supported.</p>
                </div>  <!-- log-cache -->

                <div class="h3" id="revisiongraph">
                <h3>Revision Graph</h3>

                <p>The revision graph has changed dramatically and has been rewritten almost
                completely.</p>

                <a href="img/Tortoise-1.6-trunkgraph-full.png"><img src="img/Tortoise-1.6-revisiongraph.png" alt="revision graph"/></a>

                <p>The new revision graph has many more options to tweak the output. For example,
                it is now possible to hide/show individual subtrees.

                <div class="h3" id="bugtraq-plugin">
                <h3>IBugtraq provider plugin enhancements</h3>
                <p>A new interface IBugtraqProvider2 can be used by plugins get more control
                over commits and provide more information for the user.</p>
                <p>This new interface allows a plugin to reject a commit, execute a task after
                a successful commit (to e.g., add an entry to the issue in the issue tracker).
                It also allows plugins to show an options/settings dialog. And a plugin can add
                revision properties with each commit.</p>
                <p>Developers interested in writing a plugin for an issue tracker can get the
                code for example plugins in C++ and C# from our
                <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/source/browse/#svn/trunk/contrib/issue-tracker-plugins">contrib folder</a>.</p>

                <h3>Misc changes</h3>

                <p>
                There are many more changes in 1.6 worth mentioning:
                <ul>
                <li>Ignoring multiple files by extension</li>
                <li>Filtering by bug ID in the log dialog</li>
                <li>Negating the filter in the log dialog</li>
                <li>Better handling of "runas" in the status cache</li>
                <li>Items are grouped by external in dialogs if no changelists are present</li>
                <li>Overlays in status lists for checkout depths and external/nested items</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                Of course, those are not all the enhancements/changes that were done for this 1.6
                release. You can get a more detailed list of changes from the

                <div class="h3" id="file-ext">
                <h3>File externals</h3>
                <p>Subversion 1.6 now supports single file externals as well as folder externals.
                However, there are some significant issues you should be aware of before using them.</p>
                <p>A file external is created by adding a value to the svn:externals property of
                a folder. However, once such a file external has been added it cannot be removed
                from the working copy, even if you delete the svn:externals property. The only
                way to remove the file from your working copy is to make a fresh checkout.
                See <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3351">Subversion issue #3351</a></p>
                <p>It is currently not possible to add a binary file as an external.
