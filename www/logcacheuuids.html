                <div class="entry">
                    <p>Fetching the log for slow or very big repositories can
                    take quite a while. And of course, it requires you to be
                    connected to the repository. You can't show the log
                    messages if you're not online - very annoying if the
                    network is down or you're in a place where you don't even
                    have network access.</p>

                    <p>To at least partly solve this issue, TortoiseSVN 1.5 can
                    cache the log messages from Subversion repositories. The
                    feature is implemented transparently, which means you won't
                    have to do anything to make this work. All you might notice
                    is that once you showed all log messages for your
                    repository, the next time the log dialog is a lot faster.</p>

                    <p>If you want to test this, you can show the log for the
                    <a href="http://tortoisesvn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/">TortoiseSVN repository</a>.
                    Click on the "Show all" button in the log dialog to get all
                    log messages. You will notice that it takes a while to
                    fetch all messages. If you then close the log dialog and
                    start it again for the same URL, you can click the "Show all"
                    button and all messages are fetched from the log cache.</p>

                    <p>In case you can't connect to the repository, the log
                    dialog will show you a dialog where you can choose to
                    "work offline", i.e., it won't try to connect to the
                    repository anymore but only use the cache:<br/>
                    <a href="img/logoffline.png" class="fancybox" rel="loguuids" title="logoffline">
                        <img src="img/logoffline-small.png" alt="logoffline" width="191" height="114"/>
                    </a>
                    </p>

                    <p>However, there is one problem: the log cache relies
                    upon all your repositories having different UUIDs assigned
                    to them.<br/>You can see the UUID of your repositories if
                    you have a working copy of them in the properties dialog
                    (Explorer context menu 'properties'):<br/>
                    <a href="img/repouuid.png" class="fancybox" rel="loguuids" title="repouuid">
                        <img src="img/repouuid-small.png" alt="repouuid" width="122" height="171"/>
                    </a>
                    <br/>
                    The log cache needs the UUID to distinguish between
                    different repositories which of course have different log
                    messages. The reason the log cache can't use URLs alone to
                    distinguish between repositories is that URLs just don't
                    provide that information.</p>

                    <p>For example, a URL like</p>
                    <p><code>http://example.com/svn/trunk</code></p>
                    <p>would clearly indicate that the repository is located
                    at <code>http://example.com/svn</code>. Because we can assume
                    that 'svn' is not a project name.</p>

                    <p>But a URL like</p>
                    <p><code>http://example.com/svn/project/trunk</code><br/>
                    could mean that it points to a repository for 'project',
                    but it could also mean that there's only one repository at
                    'svn' and 'project' is just a folder inside that repository.
                    So the two URLs<br/><code>http://example.com/svn/project/trunk</code><br/>
                    and<br/><code>http://example.com/svn/otherproject/trunk</code><br/>
                    could be pointing to the same repository, or to two
                    different repositories.</p>

                    <p>That's why the log cache must rely on the repository
                    UUIDs to be different for every repository.</p>

                    <p>Now, some people made the mistake of creating new
                    repositories by simply copying a default (empty) repository.
                    By doing that, all repositories have the same UUID! Yes,
                    this is a big mistake: it's called UUID for a reason: the
                    'U' stands for "Unique". This will confuse the log cache
                    completely and you will get the crash report dialog showing
                    up a lot.<br/>To fix this, you have to set a unique UUID
                    for every one of your repositories. Get the svnadmin tool
                    from the official Subversion package and run:</p>

                    <p>svnadmin setuuid REPOS_PATH</p>
                    <p>on every one of your repositories.</p>

                    <p>In case you don't have direct access to your
                    repositories or you can't change the UUID for some other
                    reason, you can disable the log cache in the TortoiseSVN
                    settings dialog:<br/>
                    <a href="img/logcachesettings.png" class="fancybox" rel="loguuids" title="logcachesettings">
                        <img src="img/logcachesettings-small.png" alt="logcachesettings" width="214" height="142"/>
                    </a>
                    </p>
                    <p>In the above screenshot, you may notice the option
                    "Allow ambiguous URLs". Now that I've told you that the
                    cache relies upon the UUIDs being different, why does it
                    also rely on URLs?<br/>Comparing URLs (i.e., simple
                    strings) is much faster than asking the repository or
                    the working copy for the repository UUID. So the cache
                    uses URLs too if possible. For example, if the cache knows
                    that the URL<br/><code>http://example.com/svn/project/trunk</code><br/>
                    points to a specific repository, it also knows that the
                    URL<br/><code>http://example.com/svn/project/trunk/subfolder</code><br/>
                    points to the very same repository, since it's not possible
                    to have a repository inside a repository.</p>
                    <p>The option "Allow ambiguous URLs" is for situations where
                    the same URL is used for different repositories - those
                    situations are very rare of course. One situation we ran
                    into problems was with
                    <a href="http://codeplex.com/SvnBridge">svnbrigde</a>.
                    That's a nice tool which allows you to access MS Team System
                    repositories with an svn client. But older versions of that
                    tool made all repositories accessible for svn clients at the
                    same URL.<br/>Once we discussed the issue with the
                    svnbridge developers, they had a version ready in almost no
                    time which provided different URLs for the different Team
                    System repositories. So with the latest version of
                    svnbridge, you should not run into that problem. But if
                    you can't update your version of svnbridge for some reason,
                    you have to activate the option "Allow ambiguous URLs".</p>
