                    We're proud to announce that TortoiseSVN 1.7.9 has been released.
                    It is linked against Subversion 1.7.6

                    <p>
                    Well, we messed up the last release: there was a bug
                    that caused other applications to crash. And since
                    we try to play nice we're releasing a new version.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    There are a few other minor bugs fixed as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We recommend that you update to this version as soon as possible.

                    With that many changes done to TortoiseSVN alone, and much

                    <p>TortoiseSVN 1.6.16 has been released.</p>
                    <p>This is a bugfix release/maintenance release,
                    linked with Subversion 1.6.17.</p>
                    <p>Subversion 1.6.17 also contains a few security related
                    fixes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2011-1752-advisory.txt">CVE-2011-1752</a></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Note: these vulnerabilities only refer to Subversion
                    servers, not clients. Which means TortoiseSVN is not affected
                    by those.</p>
                    <p>We still recommend that you update your TortoiseSVN client to
                    this latest version. You can get it from our
                    <a href="downloads.html">download</a> page.</p>
                    <p>Also note that if you upgrade from a version before
                    1.6.10, you have to run a repair install after the upgrade.
                    To do that, run the installer again and click the "Repair"
                    button. I'm sorry about the inconvenience.</p>
                    <p>If you want to know why the repair install is required,
                    you can read about the technical details in my

                    <p>A few weeks ago, we received a sponsorship from <a href="http://ooshirts.com">ooShirts</a>,
                    which will allow us to create and order some custom designed T-Shirts for TortoiseSVN.</p>
                    <img src="img/news/TShirtSample.png" alt="T-Shirt"/>
                    <p>Since we are never short on coding ideas, but on design ideas, we decided to put up a T-Shirt contest.</p>
                    <p>The contest will start today and run for four weeks. The final date for your submission is Monday, 19th September, 2011.</p>
                    <p>We will set up an image gallery with the submissions and allow users to vote on them.
                    Voting will be up for ten days</p>
                    <p>The <strong>winner of the contest</strong>, as well as the two runners-up <strong>will receive a free T-Shirt</strong> :)</p>
                    <p>We have only two requirements for the T-Shirt:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The T-Shirt must show a Tortoise, a SVG logo to start with can be found in <a href="https://tortoisesvn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/logo/tsvn_logo.svg">our repository</a>)</li>
                    <li>The T-Shirt must display the text "TortoiseSVN"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can design your Shirt directly on the <a href="http://ooshirts.com">ooShirts</a> web site.
                    The design will be saved there and you'll receive a link which will allow you to edit the design later.</p>
                    <p>For the submission, please save your design as a max. 800x800 png image and send it to

                    in a few weeks, Subversion 1.7 will be officially released.
                    This means that TortoiseSVN 1.7 will be released only a few days later.
                    Now it's high time to polish up our translations and finish as many of them as possible.
                    In most cases the biggest item on the to-do list is the TortoiseSVN manual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    There are five translations where the GUI translation is almost finished and the manual
                    is more than 90% done.
                    These are:
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/nl/">Dutch</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/fr/">French</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/ja/">Japanese</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/ru/">Russian</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/es/">Spanish</a>.
                    If at least two volunteers help, we should be able to deliver a 100% complete translation for these languages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Close behind are:
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/zh_CN/">Chinese</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/sl/">Slovenian</a>.
                    Their manuals are &gt; 70% finished, but this is going to be a tough job to get it done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Then we have the
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/id/">Indonesian</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/pl/">Polish</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/pt_BR/">Portuguese (Brazil)</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/sk/">Slovak</a>
                    manuals, which are between 40% and 60% done. It would be cool to get close to 100%,
                    but a lot of work to achieve this goal. The Polish translator is currently very active
                    and would surely appreciate any help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Finally there are several languages where no manual exists, but the GUI translation
                    is &gt;70% complete. See the <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/tortoisesvn/resource/trunk-gui/">GUI translation statistics</a>.
                    These are the easiest jobs to finish, because the GUI translation
                    doesn't have long paragraphs, but many single words or short sentences to translate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Please come and help. We need *you* :) Some information on how to join the translation
                    team is available on our <a href="translation.html">translation page</a>.

                    <p>We're happy to announce the first beta of TortoiseSVN 1.7.
                    It is linked with the latest beta of Apache Subversion 1.7.</p>
                    <p>Please give this beta a thorough test drive and help us
                    find and fix all bugs and glitches before the final release.
                    Especially if you're using TortoiseSVN in your company, you
                    should test this version on at least one workstation to make
                    sure that the final release will work for you.</p>

                <div class="entry">
                    <p>TortoiseSVN 1.6.15 has been released.</p>
                    <p>This is a bugfix release/maintenance release,
                    linked with Subversion 1.6.16. The release contains a fix
                    for a first-chance exception in the file open/save dialogs.
                    This only affects applications which are run under a debugger
                    which must also be configured to catch first-chance exceptions.
                    But since TortoiseSVN is mostly used by developers, this
                    is annoying so that's why we made this release only a few
                    days after the last release. Sorry about that.</p>
                    <p>We recommend that you update your TortoiseSVN client to
                    this latest version. You can get it from our
                    <a href="downloads.html">download</a> page.</p>
                    <p>Also note that if you upgrade from a version before
                    1.6.10, you have to run a repair install after the upgrade.
                    To do that, run the installer again and click the "Repair"
                    button. I'm sorry about the inconvenience.</p>
                    <p>If you want to know why the repair install is required,
                    you can read about the technical details in my
