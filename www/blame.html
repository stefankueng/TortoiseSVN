<!-- The class h2 is included on the main div, because the HTML which the
     server will wrap around the page includes a <div class="h2">.
     Thus, we include one here so that the page looks right when previewed
     locally, *but* we override the border which the CSS assigns to that
     style, so that we do not get two borders on the live page. -->

	<h2>TortoiseBlame</h2>
	<p>
		Sometimes you need to know why a part of your files is the way it
		is, who made that particular change and why. Or in other words:
		"Who the h*** put that command there?".
	</p>
	<p>
		Subversion has a command for this, and it is called <em>blame</em> 
		(guess why). Subversion creates a blame of a file by adding information
		about the author who committed a line, the revision the line was last
		changed and the date.
	</p>
	<p>
		TortoiseSVN has its own tool to show you those blames. In addition to
		the information other Subversion clients show, it also shows you
		the log message of the commit for each line inside a little tooltip
		window when you hover the mousepointer over a line.
	</p>

	<p>
		To make it easier to follow a specific revision (which lines exactly
		were changed in a commit), it colors lines from the same revision
		differently. Also a separate color is used for the author of the
		currently selected line.
