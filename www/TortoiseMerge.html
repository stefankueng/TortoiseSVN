	<h2>TortoiseMerge</h2>
	<p>
		Version control is all about having the history of your working progress.
		But to really see and check the history, you must be able to see and check
		what has changed between two points in time, for example what has changed
		between two releases of your product, or what was changed to fix a bug, or ...
	</p>
	<p>
		This is where TortoiseMerge helps. It is a diff / merge software tool
		for windows with a tight integration for TortoiseSVN.
	</p>
	
	<a name="diff">
	<h3>Diffing files</h3>
	<p>
		At least for files which consist of text, TortoiseMerge can help you here.
		It shows you the two versions of a file side-by-side, coloring every
		modified line in that file.
	</p>
	<img alt="TortoiseMerge showing two file diff" src="images/TMerge2Diff.png">
	<p>
		You can see in that screenshot that TortoiseMerge also colors the changes
		<em>inside</em> modified lines so you can see immediately what exactly
		has changed.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you reformat your code or text, sometimes you don't really change
		anything but only split a long line into multiple ones, or you merge
		multiple lines into one. TortoiseMerge marks such changes with a white
		circle on the left gray bar of each view. If you see such a white
		circle, you know that no real changes were made, only changes in
		<em>whitespaces</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the bottom of the window, there is a view showing the two lines your
		mouse pointer is currently hovering over. It always shows whitespace characters
		with special chars, and of course it's very handy if you have long lines
		because that view has the double width than the normal views.
	</p>
	
	<a name="merge">
	<h3>Resolving conflicts</h3>
	<p>
		But that's not all TortoiseMerge is able to do for you. It can also help
		you resolve a conflict by showing you <em>your</em> file, the file which
		has been modified by <em>someone else</em> and the file as it was before
		any of you have modified it, in its <em>original</em> state. Then you can
		easily see where the changes made conflict, and you can choose how to
		resolve that conflict.
	</p>

	<a name="patch">
	<h3>Applying patch files</h3>
	<p>
		When you're working on a project and other people have access to your
		source code, but not necessarily have the rights to commit changes to
		the repository, you sometimes get a patch file with a bug fix or an
		enhancement. TortoiseMerge helps here too, because it can apply those
		patchfiles for you.
	</p>
	<img alt="Context menu to apply a patch" src="images/ApplyPatchMenu.png">
	<br />
	<img alt="TortoiseMerge in Apply-Patch mode" src="images/ApplyPatch.png">
	<p>
		On the left is a small window containing all files which the patchfile
		wants to modify. A doubleclick on those file entries opens the file
		to be patched on the left, and the file how it looks like after the
		patch is applied on the right side.
	</p>
	<p>
		To approve the patch, saving the file is enough.
	</p>
