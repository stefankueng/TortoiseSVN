				<h1 class="title"><a href="#">Most forgotten feature</a></h1>
				$ADSENSE_TOP$
				<div class="entry">
					<p>TortoiseSVN has many features. Most of the time, you
					won't need all the features it has but only a few,
					depending on the projects you work on. But there are some
					features which you would use if you only knew they were
					there.</p>

					<p>Now you might say that if a feature is not obvious right
					away, and so hidden so that you don't even know it is there,
					then the UI should be improved to make that feature more
					obvious. And you are right.<br/>
					<br/>
					But sometimes it is not possible to do that, or we simply
					don't know how.</p>

					<p>This is one of those situations:</p>
					<div style="float: right; width: 336; height: 280">
					$ADSENSE_INPAGE$
					</div>
					<br/>

					<h3>Right drag</h3>
					<p>In the Windows explorer, it is possible to move/copy
					files not only by dragging them with the left mouse button,
					but also with the right mouse button. The difference is
					that the left-drag executes the operation immediately, and
					the right-drag will first show you a context menu where
					you can choose the operation.</p>

					<p>TortoiseSVN adds some of its commands to that right-drag
					context menu. The screenshot below shows the menu when you
					drag unversioned files/folders on to a versioned folder:</p>
					<div style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="images/rightdrag-u2v.png" alt="The right-drag context menu when dragging unversioned items onto a versioned folder" />
					</div>
					</p>

					<p>As you can see in the screenshot, TortoiseSVN allows
					you to add the files/folders to the working copy. This
					first moves or copies the files to the working copy, then
					does an "SVN Add".</p>
					<p>The entry "Apply patch" only shows up if you drag a
					<em>*.patch</em> or <em>*.diff</em> file onto a working copy.
					That command will open up TortoiseMerge, allowing you to
					apply the patchfile to that working copy location.</p>

					<p>Next is the context menu you will see if you right-drag
					versioned files/folders <b>from</b> your working copy to an
					unversioned folder:</p>

					<div style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="images/rightdrag-v2u.png" alt="The right-drag context menu when dragging versioned items onto an unversioned folder" />
					</div>

					<p>These commands let you export your items:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>SVN Export to here: exports the dragged files/folders
						to the target location, i.e. creates a copy without
						the .svn folders</li>
						<li>SVN Export all to here: exports the dragged
						files/folders to the target location, including
						unversioned files.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<p>And last but not least, the commands you get when you
					right-drag files/folders inside your working copy:</p>
					<div style="text-align: center;">
						<img src="images/rightdrag-v2v.png" alt="The right-drag context menu when dragging versioned items inside a working copy" />
					</div>

					<p>These commands help you move and copy your files and
					folders around in your working copy:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>SVN Move versioned files here: moves the files to
						the drop location. If a file already exists, it will
						ask you what to do (rename the file, overwrite it or
						cancel).</li>
						<li>SVN Move and rename versioned files here: the same
						as 'SVN Move versioned files here', except that it will
						ask for a new name for every dropped file.</li>
						<li>SVN Copy versioned files here: the same as 'SVN Move
						versioned files here' but it leaves the original file,
						i.e. the file is copied not moved</li>
						<li>SVN Copy and rename versioned files here: the same
						as 'SVN Move and rename versioned files here' but it
						leaves the original file, i.e. the files are copied
						not moved</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Now what are these features really good for? Well, you
					will know as soon as you start using them :)<br/>
					Seriously: these commands are really useful if you want to
					reorganize your working copy, move and copy files around
					or if you simply want to export your working copy to
					another folder.
