                    There's now a book available about TortoiseSVN. Of course,
                    there are books about Subversion which mention TortoiseSVN.
                    But this is (I think) the first book about TortoiseSVN.

                    <p>
                    Full disclosure: I was asked to <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/author_reviewing_for_packt">review</a>
                    the book, which I did. And I'm mentioned as a reviewer in
                    the book! So I had to write something about it here since
                    I was never mentioned in a book before :).
                    But as you can see from the review link, I didn't get paid
                    for this apart from a copy of the book and one book of my
                    choice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I had to point out quite a few mistakes (not talking about
                    spelling or gramar mistakes here) while reviewing it, and
                    they all got fixed quite nicely. Apart from one thing:
                    during the review I repeatedly pointed out that TortoiseSVN
                    will very soon get a new major release (version 1.7) and
                    that the book should be about that 1.7 version, and not
                    about version 1.6 (as it was named back then
                    <code>TortoiseSVN 1.6 Beginner's Guide</code>).
                    Well, they <strong>did</strong> listen, kind of: they changed
                    the book title, but the book <strong>content</strong> is still about
                    TortoiseSVN 1.6 &mdash; so all the screenshots and descriptions
                    still are about the current TortoiseSVN versions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    But apart from that, the book is very well written and easy
                    to follow. Of course I'm not a beginner anymore and can't
                    really judge that. But with the detailed introductions
                    about the copy-modify-merge model (not too detailed, just
                    enough to understand the basics), how to install TortoiseSVN
                    (something I always thought doesn't need a lot of explaining,
                    but that's maybe just me) and the basic operations
                    a user has to do with TortoiseSVN like committing changes
                    and reviewing changes with the log dialog, I'm sure that
                    beginners can follow it quite well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In later chapters the book covers how to resolve the
                    different kinds of conflicts that can occur. With a lot of
                    examples the user is guided through all steps necessary to
                    solve such issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Other things the book covers are (among many others which
                    I don't mention here):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>how to create and apply patches</li>
                        <li>branching and merging</li>
                        <li>how to use SubWCRev</li>
                        <li>how to use issue trackers with TortoiseSVN</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    Of course, the book also covers how you can set up your own
                    server with Subversion (svnserve and Apache), even though
                    that's not really about TortoiseSVN anymore.
                    </p>
