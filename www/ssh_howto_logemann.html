                <div class="entry">
                    <p>(revision 0.5 by (c) Marc Logemann)</p>
                    <p>Because many new subversion users run into problems when
                    attempting to use subversion with SSH, I compiled a HowTo
                    for that issue. Perhaps I will expand this HowTo later on
                    and submit it to the Subversion or TortoiseSVN docs.</p>
                    <p>-------------------------<br/>
                    Our Scenario:<br/>
                    -------------------------<br/>

                    Server: Linux or unix like system<br/>
                    Client: Windows 2000/XP (or variant)</p>
                    <p>-----------------------------------------<br/>
                    Installing subversion (server)<br/>
                    -----------------------------------------<br/>
                    I won't go into details here, because this topic is
                    covered in great length in the official Subversion
                    documentation. But one thing I want to point out
                    nevertheless. If you compile subversion from source and
                    don't provide any argument to ./configure, Subversion
                    creates a "bin" directory under /usr/local and places its
                    binaries there. This is no problem as long as you run
                    subversion as daemon, but if you want to use tunnelling
                    mode with SSH, you have to be aware that the user logging
                    into via SSH can execute the svnserve program and some
                    other binaries. For this reason, either place /usr/local/bin
                    into the PATH variable or create symlinks of your binaries
                    to the /usr/sbin directory or any other directory which is
                    commonly in the PATH.</p>
                    <p>To make sure that everything is OK. Login in with SSH
                    and the target user to the system later on and type:
                    "which svnserve". This command should tell you if svnserve
                    is reachable.<br/>
                    To check if svnserve is available through ssh, type:
                    "ssh  svnserve"</p>
                    <p>Furthermore this document assumes that you already have
                    a subversion repository created with "svnadmin create".
                    Please pay attention to the ACL of the repository in order
                    to reduce possible problems. Check that each user coming
                    in via SSH has appropriate rights to work with the
                    repository.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes your system has 'mesg y' put into the global
                    bashrc file. This will make connections with TortoisePlink
                    fail, since that line will make SSH throw out an error
                    "stdin: is not a tty". You must remove that line from
                    your bashrc file.<br/>
                    ------------------------------------------------<br/>
                    OpenSSH and certificates (server)<br/>
                    ------------------------------------------------<br/>
                    Again I wont go into details about OpenSSH installation as
                    this is covered elsewhere better. But on most systems,
                    enabling SSH is just a matter of installing an RPM. If you
                    rent a pre-installed linux server from a hosting company,
                    SSH is most likely already installed. To be sure everything
                    is in place, type: "ps xa | grep sshd" and watch out for
                    SSH jobs.</p>
                    <p>Assuming OpenSSH is installed, one of the most important
                    steps is to create a keypair for authentication. There are
                    two possible ways of creating the keys. The first way is
                    to create the keys with puttygen (a program of the putty
                    family), upload the public key to your server and use the
                    private key with putty. Because of some problems with this
                    approach, I prefer the other way. This way creates the
                    keypair with the OpenSSH tool ssh-keygen, downloads the
                    private key to your client and converts the private key
                    to a putty-style private key.</p>
                    <p>Lets do this step by step:</p>
                    <p>- login to your server<br/>
                    - type: ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t dsa -N passphrase -f mykey<br/>

                    - change "passphrase" to a secret keyword only you know<br/>
                    - type: ls -l mykey*</p>
                    <p>We just created a SSH2 DSA key with 1024 bit keyphrase.
                    You will see two files. One named "mykey" and one named
                    "mykey.pub". As you might guess, the .pub file is the
                    public key file, the other is the private one. Next create
                    a user on the server with a home directory:</p>
                    <p>- type: useradd -m myuser</p>
                    <p>You will have a directory under /home with the name
                    "myuser", create a new directory in "myuser" called ".ssh":</p>
                    <p>- type: cd /home/myuser<br/>
                    - type: mkdir .ssh</p>
                    <p>Then go to the directory where you created your keys
                    and copy the public key to the .ssh userfolder with the
                    following command:</p>
                    <p>- type: cp mykey.pub /home/myuser/.ssh/authorized_keys</p>

                    <p>or if you already have some keys in place</p>
                    <p>- type: cat mykey.pub &gt;&gt; /home/myuser/.ssh/authorized_keys</p>
                    <p>Please pay attention to the filename, it really must
                    be "authorized_keys". In some old OpenSSH implementations,
                    it was "authorized_keys2". Now download the private key
                    file to your client computer. Remember, the file was "mykey"</p>
                    <p>------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
                    SSH key generation and connection check (client)<br/>
                    ------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
                    Grab the tools we need for doing SSH on windows on this site:<br/>
                    http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</p>

                    <p>Just go to the download section and get "Putty", "Plink",
                    "Pageant" and "Puttygen"</p>
                    <p>In order to use the private key we get from the server,
                    we have to convert it to a putty format. This is because
                    the private key file format is not specified by some
                    standard body. To do this we simple open "puttygen" and
                    open the "conversions" menu and chose "Import Key". Then
                    browse to your file "mykey" which you got from the server
                    enter your provided passphrase upon creation of the key.
                    Finally click "Save private key" and save the file as
                    "mykey.PPK" somewhere on disk.</p>
                    <p>Now we are ready to use this key for the first time to
                    test the connection. In order to do this, we open the
                    program "putty" and create a new session like this:</p>
                    <p>Session-&gt;HostName: Hostname or IP Adress of your server<br/>
                    Session-&gt;Protocol: SSH<br/>
                    Session-&gt;Saved Sessions: MyConnection<br/>
                    SSH-&gt;Prefered SSH Protocol version: 2<br/>

                    SSH-&gt;Auth-&gt;Private Key file for auth: $PATH$\mykey.PKK
                    (replace $PATH$ with real path to the mykey.PKK file)</p>
                    <p>Then go back to Session tab and hit "save" button. You
                    will see "MyConnection" in the list of available connections.</p>
                    <p>Next click "open" and you should see a telnet login
                    prompt. Use "myuser" as username (without double quotes
                    of course) and if everything is OK, you don't have to
                    provide a password to your system. If the system still
                    requires a password, something went wrong. See Debugging
                    Section of this HowTo.</p>
                    <p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>
                    Testing SSH with TortoiseSVN (client)<br/>
                    -----------------------------------------------<br/>
                    After installing TortoiseSVN right click on some folder
                    inside your Windows Explorer. You will see a menu item
                    called TortoiseSVN-&gt;RepoBrowser. After opening the
                    browser you have to enter a URL like this:</p>

                    <p>svn+ssh://myuser@MyConnection/usr/local/repos</p>
                    <p>Lets talk briefly about the URL (if you need more infos,
                    check the subversion docs). The Schema name is "svn+ssh",
                    this tells Tortoise how to handle the requests to the
                    server. After the double slashed, you can provide the
                    user which is trying to connect to the server, in our case
                    this is "myuser". After the "@", we supply our putty
                    session name. This session name contains all details like
                    where to find the private key and the servers IP or DNS.
                    Last we have to provide the full path to the repository.
                    Its assumed that a subversion repository resides at
                    /usr/local/repos</p>
                    <p>If you submit the URL, you will see an opened tree on
                    the next screen until the node "repos". Yet, there has not
                    been made any connection, because the tree representation
                    comes from the supplied URL. When you hit the "+" button
                    in front of "repos", the connection will be established
                    and you will see the "+" sign disappearing if you don't
                    have anything in the repository or you will see your
                    already imported projects and files.</p>
                    <p>Right now, you should have a running SSH Tunnel in
                    conjunction with TortoiseSVN.</p>
                    <p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>
                    Configuration Variants (pageant)<br/>
                    -----------------------------------------------<br/>
                    Now I will continue to show some configuration variants,
                    that can be helpful during everyday work.</p>
                    <p>One way to simplify the URL in TortoiseSVN is to set
                    the user inside the putty session. For this you have to
                    load your already defined session "MyConnection" in putty
                    make the following entry:</p>

                    <p>connection-&gt;Auto Login username: myuser</p>
                    <p>Then save your putty session as before and try the
                    following URL inside Tortoise:<br/>
                    svn+ssh://MyConnection/usr/local/repos</p>
                    <p>This time we only provide the putty session "MyConnection"
                    to the SSH client TortoiseSVN uses (TortoisePlink.exe).
                    This client is capable of checking the session for all
                    necessary details like loginuser or server ip.</p>
                    <p>Some people like using pageant for storing all their
                    keys and in fact each howto explains that it is important
                    to place your keys there. In fact, because a putty session
                    is capable of storing a key, you don't need pageant for
                    normal business. But imagine you want to store keys for
                    several users, in that case, you would have to edit the
                    putty session over and over again, depending on the user
                    you are trying to connect with. For this situation pageant
                    makes perfectly sense, because when putty, plink,
                    TortoisePlink or any other putty-based tool is trying to
                    connect to a SSH server, it checks all private keys that
                    pageant carries to initiate the connection.</p>
                    <p>For this task, simply start pageant and add a key. It
                    should be the same private key you defined in the putty
                    session above. If you use pageant for private keys storage,
                    you can delete the "SSH-&gt;Auth-&gt;Private Key file for
                    auth" section inside your putty session. You can add more
                    keys for other systems or other users of course. If you
                    don't want to repeat this procedure after every reboot of
                    your client, you should place the pageant in autostart
                    group of your windows installation. You can append the
                    keys with complete paths as command line arguments to
                    pageant.exe</p>
                    <p>The last way to connect to a SSH server is by just
                    using this URL inside TortoiseSVN:</p>

                    <p>svn+ssh://myuser@100.101.102.103/usr/local/repos</p>
                    <p>As you can see, we dont use a saved putty session but
                    an IP address as connection target. We also supply the
                    user, but you might ask how the private key file will be
                    found. Because TortoisePlink.exe (the standard SSH client
                    for TortoiseSVN) is a modified version of the plink tool
                    from the putty suite, also TortoiseSVN looks for a running
                    pageant and will try all the keys stored in pageant.</p>
