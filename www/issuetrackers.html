<!-- The class h2 is included on the main div, because the HTML which the
     server will wrap around the page includes a <div class="h2">.
     Thus, we include one here so that the page looks right when previewed
     locally, *but* we override the border which the CSS assigns to that
     style, so that we do not get two borders on the live page. -->

	<h2>Integration with issue trackers</h2>
	<p>
	It is very common in Software Development for changes to be related to a 
	specific bug or issue ID. Users of bug tracking systems (issue trackers) 
	would like to associate the changes they make in Subversion with a specific 
	ID in their issue tracker. Most issue trackers therefore provide a pre-commit 
	hook script which parses the log message to find the bug ID with which the 
	commit is associated. This is somewhat error prone since it relies on the 
	user to write the log message properly so that the pre-commit hook script 
	can parse it correctly. 
	</p>
	<p>
	TortoiseSVN can help the user in two ways: 
	<ul>
		<li>
		When the user enters a log message, a well defined line including the issue 
		number associated with the commit can be added automatically. This reduces 
		the risk that the user enters the issue number in a way the bug tracking 
		tools can't parse correctly.
		</li>
		<li>
		Or TortoiseSVN can highlight the part of the entered log message which is 
		recognized by the issue tracker. That way the user knows that the log message 
		can be parsed correctly. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	When the user browses the log messages, TortoiseSVN creates a link out of each 
	bug ID in the log message which fires up the browser to the issue mentioned. 
	</p>
	
	<a name="commit">
	<h3>Entering log messages</h3>
	<p>
	When you enter your log message for a commit, the issue number is either
	marked with a different color so you can see and check that you have entered
	it correctly and it will be recognized as such. Or you can enter the issue
	number directly in the box in the right top corner of the dialog.
	</p>
	<p>
	Of course, you can also combine those two input forms and have both the coloring
	and the input box.

	<a name="log">
	<h3>Checking log messages</h3>
	<p>
	The log dialog also recognizes the issue numbers as such and converts them into a link
	pointing to the issue in your issuetracker.
	</p>
	<p>
	In a separate column, which is only visible if you assigned your project with an issuetracker,
	the issue number is shown. You can that way immediately see which commit corresponds to which
	issue.
