        <p>
            This section provides a step-by-step guide to setting up
            Subversion and TortoiseSVN to use the <code>svn+ssh</code>
            protocol. If you already use authenticated SSH connections to login
            to your server, then you are already there and you can find more detail
            in the Subversion book. If you are not using SSH but would like to do
            so to protect your Subversion installation, this guide gives a simple
            method which does not involve creating a separate SSH user account
            on the server for every subversion user.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this implementation we create a single SSH user account for
            all subversion users, and use different authentication keys to
            differentiate between the real Subversion users.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this appendix we assume that you already have the subversion tools
            installed, and that you have created a repository as detailed elsewhere
            in this manual. Note that you should <em>not</em> start
            svnserve as a service or daemon when used with SSH.
        </p>
        <p>
            Much of the information here comes from a tutorial
            provided by Marc Logemann, which has been archived at
            <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/ssh_howto_logemann.html">tortoisesvn.net</a>.
            Additional information on setting up a Windows server was
            provided by Thorsten MÃ¼ller. Thanks guys!

        </p>

        <h2>Setting Up a Linux Server</h2>
        <p>
            You need to have SSH enabled on the server, and here we assume
            that you will be using OpenSSH. On most distributions this will
            already be installed. To find out, look for ssh jobs by typing:
        </p>
<pre>
ps xa | grep sshd
</pre>
        <p>
            One point to note is that if you build Subversion from source and
            do not provide any argument to <cite>./configure</cite>,
            Subversion creates a <cite>bin</cite> directory under
            <cite>/usr/local</cite> and places its binaries there.
            If you want to use tunneling mode with SSH, you have to be aware
            that the user logging in via SSH needs to execute the svnserve program
            and some other binaries. For this reason, either place
            <cite>/usr/local/bin</cite> into the <code>PATH</code> variable
            or create symbolic links of your binaries to the <cite>/usr/sbin</cite>
            directory, or to any other directory which is commonly in the
            <code>PATH</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To check that everything is OK, login in as the target user with SSH
            and test whether svnserve is now reachable by typing:
        </p>
<pre>
which svnserve
</pre>
        <p>
            Create a new user which we will use to access the svn repository:
        </p>
<pre>
useradd -m svnuser
</pre>
        <p>
            Be sure to give this user full access rights to the repository.
        </p>
        <h2>Setting Up a Windows Server</h2>
        <p>
            Install Cygwin SSH daemon as described in
            <a href="http://www.antedes.com/blog/network/how-to-install-openssh-sshd-server-and-sftp-server-on-a-windows-xp">this article</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Create a new Windows user account <code>svnuser</code> which
            we will use to access the repository.
            Be sure to give this user full access rights to the repository.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there is no password file yet then create one from the Cygwin console using:
        </p>
<pre>
mkpasswd -l > /etc/passwd
</pre>

        <h2>SSH Client Tools for use with TortoiseSVN</h2>
        <p>
            Grab the tools we need for using SSH on the windows client from the
            <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY site</a>.
            Just go to the download section and get
            <cite>Putty</cite>,
            <cite>Plink</cite>,
            <cite>Pageant</cite> and
            <cite>Puttygen</cite>.
        </p>
        <h2>Creating OpenSSH Certificates</h2>
        <p>
            The next step is to create a key pair for authentication.
            There are two possible ways to create keys. The first is to
            create the keys with PuTTYgen on the client, upload the public
            key to your server and use the private key with PuTTY.
            The other is to create the key pair with the OpenSSH tool
            ssh-keygen, download the private key to your client and
            convert the private key to a PuTTY-style private key.
        </p>
            <h3>Create Keys using ssh-keygen</h3>
            <p>
                Login to the server as <code>root</code> or
                <code>svnuser</code> and type:
            </p>
<pre>
ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t dsa -N passphrase -f keyfile
</pre>
            <p>
                substituting a real pass-phrase (which only you know) and key file.
                We just created a SSH2 DSA key with 1024 bit key-phrase.
                If you type
            </p>
<pre>
ls -l keyfile*
</pre>
            <p>
                you will see two files, <cite>keyfile</cite> and
                <cite>keyfile.pub</cite>. As you might guess, the
                <cite>.pub</cite> file is the public key file, the
                other is the private one.
            </p>
            <p>
                Append the public key to those in the <cite>.ssh</cite>
                folder within the <code>svnuser</code> home directory:
            </p>
<pre>
cat keyfile.pub &gt;&gt; /home/svnuser/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>.
            <p>
                In order to use the private key we generated, we have to
                convert it to a putty format. This is because the private
                key file format is not specified by a standards body.
                After you download the private key file to your client PC,
                start PuTTYgen and use
                <strong>Conversions -&gt; Import key</strong>
                Browse to your file <cite>keyfile</cite> which you got
                from the server the passphrase you used when creating the key.
                Finally click on <strong>Save private key</strong> and
                save the file as <cite>keyfile.PPK</cite>.
            </p>
            <h3>Create Keys using PuTTYgen</h3>
            <p>
                Use PuTTYgen to generate a public-key/private-key pair and
                save it. Copy the public key to the server and append it to
                those in the <cite>.ssh</cite> folder within the
                <code>svnuser</code> home directory:
            </p>
<pre>
cat keyfile.pub &gt;&gt; /home/svnuser/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>
        <h2>Test using PuTTY</h2>
        <p>
            To test the connection we will use PuTTY. Start the program and
            on the <strong>Session</strong> tab set the hostname to
            the name or IP address of your server, the protocol to SSH and
            save the session as <code>SvnConnection</code> or whatever
            name you prefer. On the <strong>SSH</strong> tab set the
            preferred SSH protocol version to 2 and from <strong>Auth</strong>
            set the full path to the <code>.PPK</code> private key file you
            converted earlier.
            Go back to the <strong>Sessions</strong> tab and hit the
            <strong>Save</strong> button. You will now see
            <code>SvnConnection</code> in the list of saved sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Click on <strong>Open</strong> and you should see a telnet
            style login prompt. Use <code>svnuser</code> as the user name
            and if all is well you should connect directly without being
            prompted for a password.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may need to edit <cite>/etc/sshd_config</cite> on the
            server. Edit lines as follows and restart the SSH service afterwards.
        </p>
<pre>
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitEmptyPasswords no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no</pre>
        <h2>Testing SSH with TortoiseSVN</h2>
        <p>
            So far we have only tested that you can login using SSH. Now we need
            to make sure that the SSH connection can actually run svnserve.
            On the server modify <cite>/home/svnuser/.ssh/authorized_keys</cite>
            as follows to allow many subversion authors to use the same system account,
            <code>svnuser</code>. Note that every subversion author uses the same
            login but a different authentication key, thus you have to add one line for
            every author. Note: This is all on one very long line.
        </p>
<pre>
command="svnserve -t -r &lt;ReposRootPath&gt; --tunnel-user=&lt;author&gt;",
         no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,
         no-pty ssh-rsa &lt;PublicKey&gt; &lt;Comment&gt;</pre>
        <p>
            There are several values that you need to set according to your setup.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>&lt;ReposRootPath&gt;</code> should be replaced with the
            path to the directory containing your repositories. This avoids the
            need to specify full server paths within URLs. Note that you must use
            forward slashes even on a Windows server, e.g.
            <cite>c:/svn/reposroot</cite>. In the examples below we assume
            that you have a repository folder within the repository root called
            <cite>repos</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>&lt;author&gt;</code> should be replaced with the svn author
            that you want to be stored on commit. This also allows svnserve to use
            its own access rights within <cite>svnserve.conf</cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>&lt;PublicKey&gt;</code> should be replaced with the
            public key that you generated earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>&lt;Comment&gt;</code> can be any comment you like, but it is
            useful for mapping an svn author name to the person's real name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right click on any folder in Windows Explorer and select
            <strong>TortoiseSVN -&gt; Repo-Browser</strong>
            You will be prompted to enter a URL, so enter one in this form:
        </p>
<pre>
svn+ssh://svnuser@SvnConnection/repos
</pre>
        <p>
            What does this URL mean? The Schema name is <code>svn+ssh</code>
            which tells TortoiseSVN how to handle the requests to the server.
            After the double slash, you specify the user to connect to the server,
            in our case <code>svnuser</code>. After the <code>@</code>
            we supply our PuTTY session name.
            This session name contains all details like where to find
            the private key and the server's IP or DNS. Lastly we have to
            provide the path to the repository, relative to the repository root
            on the server, as specified in the <cite>authorized_keys</cite> file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Click on <strong>OK</strong> and you should be able to browse
            the repository content. If so you now have a running SSH tunnel in
            conjunction with TortoiseSVN.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that by default TortoiseSVN uses its own version of Plink to
            connect. This avoids a console window popping up for every authentication
            attempt, but it also means that there is nowhere for error messages to
            appear. If you receive the error <q>Unable to write to standard output</q>,
            you can try specifying Plink as the client in TortoiseSVN's network settings.
            This will allow you to see the real error message generated by Plink.
        </p>
        <h2>SSH Configuration Variants</h2>
        <p>
            One way to simplify the URL in TortoiseSVN is to set the
            user inside the PuTTY session. For this you have to load
            your already defined session <code>SvnConnection</code>
            in PuTTY and in the <strong>Connection</strong> tab set
            <strong>Auto login user</strong> to the user name, e.g.
            <code>svnuser</code>. Save your PuTTY session as before
            and try the following URL inside TortoiseSVN:
        </p>
<pre>
svn+ssh://SvnConnection/repos
</pre>
        <p>
            This time we only provide the PuTTY session <code>SvnConnection</code>
            to the SSH client TortoiseSVN uses (TortoisePlink.exe).
            This client will check the session for all necessary details.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the time of writing PuTTY does not check all saved configurations,
            so if you have multiple configurations with the same server name, it
            will pick the first one which matches. Also, if you edit the default
            configuration and save it, the auto login user name is
            <em>not</em> saved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many people like to use Pageant for storing all their keys.
            Because a PuTTY session is capable of storing a key, you don't
            always need Pageant. But imagine you want to store keys for several
            different servers; in that case you would have to edit the
            PuTTY session over and over again, depending on the server you are
            trying to connect with. In this situation Pageant makes perfect sense,
            because when PuTTY, Plink, TortoisePlink or any other PuTTY-based tool
            is trying to connect to an SSH server, it checks all private keys that
            Pageant holds to initiate the connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this task, simply run Pageant and add the private key. It should
            be the same private key you defined in the PuTTY session above.
            If you use Pageant for private key storage, you can delete the reference
            to the private key file in your saved PuTTY session.
            You can add more keys for other servers, or other users of course.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't want to repeat this procedure after every reboot of your
            client, you should place Pageant in the auto-start group of your
            Windows installation. You can append the keys with
            complete paths as command line arguments to Pageant.exe.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last way to connect to an SSH server is simply by using this URL
            inside TortoiseSVN:
        </p>
<pre>
svn+ssh://svnuser@100.101.102.103/repos
svn+ssh://svnuser@mydomain.com/repos</pre>
        <p>
            As you can see, we don't use a saved PuTTY session but an IP address
            (or domain name) as the connection target. We also supply the user,
            but you might ask how the private key file will be found.
            Because TortoisePlink.exe is just a modified version of the standard
            Plink tool from the PuTTY suite, TortoiseSVN will also try all the keys
            stored in Pageant.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you use this last method, be sure you do not have a default username
            set in PuTTY. We have had reports of a bug in PuTTY causing connections
            to close in this case. To remove the default user, simply clear
            <cite>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\Putty\Sessions\Default%20Settings\HostName</cite>.
