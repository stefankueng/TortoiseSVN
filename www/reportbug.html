                    <h3>Preparations</h3>
                    <p>
                    Before you report a bug, please make sure you have completed the following steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Update to the current version. Reports for older
                        versions <strong>will be ignored.</strong></li>
                        <li>Check the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/source/browse/trunk/src/Changelog.txt">Changelog</a>
                        file from /trunk/ and see if your bug has already been
                        fixed.</li>
                        <li>If possible, update to the latest nightly build
                        and see if the bug is still there. You can find the
                        link to the nightly builds on our
                        <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a> page.</li>
                        <li>Check the <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewForums.do">mailing list archive</a>.
                        Maybe someone else already reported the same bug you're
                        seeing, and if so that bug might be already fixed.</li>
                        <li>Check the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/wiki/IssueTracker?tm=3">issue tracker</a>.
                        Maybe your bug has already been filed there.</li>
                        <li>If you've got a zip file from our crashreporting
                        tool, send it to <span class="nobr"><em>crashreports at tortoisesvn.tigris.org</em></span>.
                        Note that we don't answer mails there. Other kinds
                        of bugreports on that list will be deleted without
                        being read.
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>How to write the bug report</h3>
                    <p>There is a large number of TortoiseSVN users. There is
                    a much small number of people who actually develop
                    TortoiseSVN. There is an even smaller number of people
                    who actively fix bugs reported by users.</p>
                    <p>What does this mean for you, an aspiring bug reporter?
                    In order to catch the eye of one of these few
                    <strong>volunteers</strong>, you'll need to take to heart a few
                    tips on how to report a bug so that they can and will
                    help you.</p>
                    <p>Take special note of that word in bold above. The people
                    who are going to help you with a bug you report are
                    <strong>volunteers</strong>. Not only are you not paying them to
                    help you, but nobody else is either. So, be nice to them.</p>
                    <p>Beyond that golden rule, what follows are some
                    additional tips on ways to make your bug report better
                    so that someone will be able to help you.</p>

                    <h4>The basics: what you did, what you wanted to happen,
                    and what actually happened.</h4>
                    <p>Those are the three basic elements of a bug report.
                    You need to tell us exactly what you did (for example,
                    "I right-clicked on "make happy meal"), what you expected
                    to have happened (to continue the example,
                    "I expected TortoiseSVN to serve me a happy meal with a
                    hamburger and onion rings"), and what actually happened
                    ("It gave me a happy meal with french fries.").</p>
                    <p>Yes, the example is silly. But if your bug report
                    simply said "The make_happy_meal function doesn't work,"
                    you will very likely get a reply saying "It works fine for
                    me", because we can't guess what you were expecting to
                    happen. By giving all the information you might get a reply
                    like "That's because you can't have onion rings in a happy
                    meal, you can only have french fries or curly fries." By
                    telling us what you asked for, what you expected to get,
                    and what you actually got, we don't have to guess what
                    you mean.</p>

                    <h4>Only report one problem in each bug report</h4>
                    If you have encountered two bugs that don't appear to be
                    related, create a new bug report for each one. This makes
                    it easier for different people to help with the different
                    bugs.

                    <h4>Where to send the report to?</h4>
                    <p>Bug reports must be mailed to our mailing list
                    <span class="nobr"><em>users at tortoisesvn tigris org</em></span>.
