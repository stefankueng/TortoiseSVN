                <div class="entry">
                    <p>During the last few weeks, I got a lot of crash reports
                    for TortoiseSVN which indicated that a certain date API
                    returned bogus data, which either lead to a crash (hence
                    the crash reports) or garbled date strings in various
                    TortoiseSVN dialogs (these were reported on our mailing
                    lists).</p>

                    <p>From the crash dump files, I could see where the crash
                    happened, why the crash happened there. But what remained
                    unclear was why the date API returned illegal data.</p>

                    <p>I've tried to reproduce the problem with a small test
                    application that feed random dates to that API, even
                    illegal dates (e.g., Feb, 30). But the API always returned
                    valid data or returned with an error code and left the
                    output data intact. So there had to be some other reasons
                    for this issue.</p>

                    <p>So I tried contacting those who sent me those crash
                    reports with the dump files. The first few either didn't
                    respond or the reply address was not valid. Then finally
                    a few days ago Asaf Salhov answered my questions and we
                    could figure out the reason behind those problems:</p>

                    <p>Due to changes in the daylight saving times in Israel,
                    many IT departments tweaked a registry key to make Windows
                    deal with those changes. This worked ok for a long time.<br/>
                    But when Microsoft released service pack 3 for Windows XP,
                    those registry tweaks caused the problem. I still don't
                    know why exactly the installation of the SP3 will cause
                    these problems, but at least we found a solution to fix it:</p>

                    <p>Either uncheck the "Automatically set Daylight Savings
                    Time" option in your date settings, or try this update from
                    Microsoft: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953917">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953917"</a></p>

                    <p>That's all you have to do to fix this problem.</p>

                    <p>Note: Since I've searched the web for solutions to this
                    problem, I found a lot of other reports for other
                    applications which suffer from the very same problem.
                    That means this is not really an issue with TortoiseSVN or
                    Subversion. So even if you don't use TortoiseSVN but you
                    know (or suspect) that your computer has the above
                    mentioned registry tweak done, you should use tzedit.exe to
                    fix this.</p>

                    <p>I've written a small tool which should be able to test
                    for this problem. You can download the tool from
                    <a href="files/DateTest.exe">http://tortoisesvn.net/files/DateTest.exe</a>.<br/>

                    Run the tool in a command line window. The tool tries to
                    convert a fixed system time to a local time (using the
                    SystemTimeToTzSpecificLocalTime API). The tool will show
                    you either an error if the function fails, or the
                    converted date.</p>

                    <p>If the function call fails, you will see the following
                    output:<br/>

                    SystemTimeToTzSpecificLocalTime failed! GetLastError() returned: 87<br/>
                    The parameter is incorrect.</p>

                    <p>if the function suceeds, the output is:<br/>
                    SystemTimeToTzSpecificLocalTime succeeded<br/>
                    the resulting SYSTEMTIME is:<br/>
                    Year = 2008<br/>
                    Month = 5<br/>

                    Day of week = 3<br/>
                    Day = 7<br/>
                    Hour = 6<br/>
                    Minute = 7<br/>
                    Second = 59<br/>
                    Milliseconds = 190</p>
