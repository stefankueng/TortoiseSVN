                   <li>Linked against SVN 1.2</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.2 is compatible with 1.0 and 1.1 servers. Of course,
                some of the new 1.2 features may not be available unless the server is
                upgraded to the latest version.</p>

                <p>If you access a BDB repository using <code>file://</code> access
                you will need to update that repository to BDB 4.3 format.
                Instructions on how to do that can be found on the
                <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#bdb43-upgrade">
                Subversion FAQ page</a></p>

                <p>Subversion 1.2 introduces an alternative history storage mechanism
                known as xdelta differencing. Reconstructing older data from repositories
                stored in the new format is much faster, resulting in a noticeable speedup
                for operations such as blame, checkout, diff and merge. Although converting
                repositories is not required, you may wish to do so in order to gain faster
                access. To do that you need to perform a dump/load cycle using the command
                line svnadmin tool. Look at the
                <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch05s03.html#svn-ch-5-sect-3.5">
                Subversion Manual</a> for instructions on how to do that.</p>

                <p>The Windows 98/Me and Windows NT 4.0 operating systems are no longer
                supported in TortoiseSVN 1.2. That's not because we want to be unfriendly,
                but because there are just too many incompatibilities in these older OS versions
                which we have to work around, and as none of the developers use these systems
                it is impossible to test and debug properly. If you want to use TortoiseSVN
                with these systems, you should use the 1.1.x line which is still available
                from our download page.</p>

                <h2>New Features</h2>

                <h3>File Locking (<em>also requires updated server</em>)</h3>

                <p>"Locking" is a long-requested feature, often known in other systems
                as "reserved checkouts".  While Subversion is still primarily a <a
                href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch02s02.html#svn-ch-2-sect-2.3">copy-modify-merge</a>
                system focused on parallel development, there is widespread
                acknowledgement that not all files are easily mergeable &mdash;
                binary files in particular, such as artwork, compressed files,
                proprietary binary formats, or any other non-line-based data.</p>

                <p>The goal of the new locking feature is twofold.  First, provide a
                means to force serialized write-access to a file.  Second, provide a
                communication mechanism to prevent users from wasting time on
                unmergable changes.</p>

                <p>The first goal is accomplished using file locks. TortoiseSVN has new
                context menu entries to <code>Get Lock</code> and <code>Release Lock</code>.
                When a user locks a file, no other user may commit a change to the file
                or delete it from the repository.</p>

                <p>Locks can also be stolen or broken, say if the person who locked a
                file goes on holiday and forgets to unlock. New lock hooks are available
                to system administrators to set their own locking policy. Refer to
                the Subversion documentation for details on repository administration.</p>

                <p>The second goal &mdash; preventing a user from wasting time on an
                unmergable change &mdash; is accomplished via a new property,
                <code>svn:needs-lock</code>.  Users (or administrators) are encouraged to
                set this property on any file that is unmergeable.  When present, this
                property causes the file to be read-only <em>unless</em> the working
                copy holds a lock-token for the file, in which case the file is
                read-write.  TortoiseSVN uses a new status overlay to indicate when
                a file is in the read-only state, which warns you that you need to
                acquire a lock before editing.</p>

                <p><strong>Warning</strong>: if you have a team of users all accessing
                a repository via <code>file://</code>, then <strong>all</strong> users
                must use 1.2 clients. Pre-1.2 clients will unknowingly ignore locks.</p>

                <h3>New External Status Cache</h3>

                <p>TortoiseSVN has always had a recursive overlay feature whereby overlay
                changes in lower level folders are propagated up through the folder hierarchy
                so that you don't forget about changes you made deep in the tree. However,
                in previous releases this feature was only useable with very small working
                copies due to the delay in getting the status information.</p>

                <p>In release 1.2, a new <code>TSVNCache</code> program is used to maintain
                a cache of your working copy status, providing much faster access to this
                information. Not only does this prevent explorer from blocking while
                acquiring status, but it also makes recursive overlays workable.</p>

                <p>Note: Explorer is much more responsive with the new cache because it
                displays pages before the full information is available and refreshes as
                required. This means that the status you see immediately may not be recursive
                but the non-recursive status.
                Depending on the size of your working copy it may take a second or two for
                the recursive status to filter through.</p>

                <p>Subversion has always suffered from a speed problem if the timestamp
                on a file changes and the content doesn't. This forces subversion to
                do a byte-by-byte compare of the file with BASE to check whether it has
                really changed. In this new release, you can fix such timestamp mismatches
                using the <code>Cleanup</code> menu entry. If your WC has become slow to
                check, try doing a cleanup.</p>

                <h3>Better Use of Overlays</h3>

                <p>Windows supports only 15 icon overlays, and uses 3 of these itself.
                If both TortoiseSVN and TortoiseCVS are installed there are simply not
                enough overlays for both applications.</p>

                <p>In this release, TortoiseSVN checks to see how many overlays are
                required by other apps, and only installs essential ones if there
                are not enough for everyone. It also displays an alternative overlay
                if the preferred one is not available. For example if the <code>Added</code>
                overlay is not available, the <code>Modified</code> overlay will be used
                instead.</p>

                <h2>Enhancements and Bugfixes</h2>

                <p>This is a major new release, and almost all the main dialogs have
                been improved in some way, either to add new features or to make
                them easier to use. Some of the main ones are mentioned below,
                and there have also been many minor bugfixes. To see the full list
                of changes check the
                <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/source/browse/tags/version_1.2.0/src/Changelog.txt">
                ChangeLog</a></p>

                <h3>Merge Dialog</h3>
                <p>This has been changed considerably to make the difficult subject
                of merging easier to understand and use. You can now select revisions
                to merge using the revision log dialog, without trying to work out
                the correct numbers to insert in the revision boxes.</p>

                <h3>Log Dialog</h3>
                <p>New filters allow you to search within the log messages, or restrict
                to a date range.</p>

                <p>The new Subversion 1.2 API allows you to fetch a given number of
                log messages rather than the log messages for a given number of
                repository revisions. This makes it much easier to display a useful
                number of messages, and to get more messages as required.</p>

                <p>Note - this feature works best with Subversion 1.2 servers.
                It will work with earlier servers, but will be slow. The server
                does not understand the new parameter and returns all log messages,
                which the Subversion client then filters. This results in very slow
                response. TortoiseSVN has a setting which allows you to use the old
                API in case you need to work with an older server.</p>

                <p>You can now compare two revisions of a folder. TortoiseSVN will
                list the files which have changed, allowing you to diff each one
                individually.</p>

                <p>You can now resize the 3 panes of the log dialog individually.</p>

                <p>The log dialog has a number of other new context menus, allowing
                you to do more.</p>

                <h3>Commit Dialog</h3>
                <p>Autocompletion now picks up some language-dependent keywords
                (usually class/method/variable name) using regular expressions.</p>

                <p>Bugtracking integration has been extended using regular expressions,
                making it easier to pick out your issue IDs. Read about this in the
                <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/source/browse/tags/version_1.2.0/doc/issuetrackers.txt">
                Issue Tracker Integration Spec</a>.</p>

                <p>Comment history is now inserted at the current cursor position,
                rather than always at the beginning of any existing message.</p>

                <h3>Repository Browser</h3>
                <p>Several new context menu entries, allowing you to export or
                checkout directly from the browser.</p>

                <p>Open files using the Windows file association, or a program
                of your choice.</p>

                <h3>Cleanup</h3>
                <p>Subversion 1.2 adds extra functionality to the Cleanup command so that
                it now makes more repairs. If the timestamp of a working copy file does
                not match Subversion's recorded timestamp, but the file length does match,
                Subversion does a byte-by-byte check to see if the files really are
                different, and that can slow down status checks.</p>

                <p><code>Cleanup</code> now checks these files and if the content matches,
                it resets its record of the timestamp so that future checks will run
                faster. If your working copy is very slow to produce the list of files
                in the <code>Check for Modifications</code> and <code>Commit</code> dialogs,
                try running <code>Cleanup</code> on your working copy. If you used the
                <code>Use commit timestamps</code> option, you should definitely do this.</p>

                <h3>Settings Dialog</h3>
                <p>The settings dialog now has an updated interface which is less
                crowded and easier to use. The options are also grouped in a more
                logical manner, so you know where to look for things.</p>

                <h3>Tortoise Merge</h3>
                <p>You can opt to ignore case differences when viewing file difference.
                This is useful for VB source, which sometimes gets changed by the
                IDE.</p>
