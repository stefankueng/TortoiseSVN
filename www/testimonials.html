                    Our developers at SaleHoo, a leading wholesale directory
                    use TortoiseSVN every day and itâ€™s made a massive difference
                    to their productivity and efficiency. We use it across all
                    our development work as it lets us to keep track of changes
                    to files while multiple developers (including our remote
                    ones) are working on them at once. My lead developer often
                    remarks that being able to easily see exactly what other
                    developers have been working on is both time and
                    sanity-saving!  Thanks heaps for the great software guys.

                    <blockquote><div>We use TortoiseSVN daily in our office and
                    recommend it to everyone who is asking about a windows svn
                    client. It was first use by our Delphi developer who keep
                    a repo on his iPod which allowed him to work from home
                    while keeping all the files in sync. We now use it on all
                    our development work including of 20 website projects which
                    allows us to keep track of changes to our PHP, CSS and JS
                    files along with having multiple developers working on the
                    site at once without having to worry about lost work.<br/>
                    The shell integration is fantastic, quickly able see what
                    files have changed at a glance and access svn commands from
                    the right click menu make it a breeze.<br/>
                    Being able to use svn diff is a very powerful tool in
                    a developers belt, and with TSVN gui for seeing the diff
                    makes it easy. Seeing changes made in the working copy or
                    yesterday, last week etc is a time and sanity saving tool.
                    It also allows you to review other developers work,
                    changes they've made and then blame them for when they make
                    a hash of things.<br/>
                    Being open source is a great bonus, a valuable tool at
                    price you just can't beat!

                    <blockquote><div>I work as a Systems Analyst (i.e.
                    requirements procurement/management) for a $1.8 billion
                    (US est.) education media conglomerate at the corporate
                    level.  Only one systems analysis group at one of our
                    business units (~$400 million US) has adopted T/SVN as of
                    yet.  I was part of this group at the time and was tasked
                    with researching version control and requirements
                    management tools for adoption.<br/><br/>
                    I chose T/SVN for the following reasons:<br/>
                    1.  Directory/Whole Repository versioning.<br/>
                    2.  Efficient resource usage (cost, network).<br/>
                    3.  Excellent and extensive documentation.<br/>
                    4.  Covered requirements for our needs (we had several
                    solutions hanging around that were unsatisfactory for one
                    reason or another including ClearCase, Documentum, and more).<br/><br/>
                    I chose TSVN for the following additional reasons:<br/>
                    1.  Ease of use.<br/>
                    2.  Mailing list quality (have even participated at times).<br/>
                    3.  An extremely low (and sometimes negative!) ATITSTFAB.<br/>
                    4.  Word doc diff script included.<br/><br/>
                    There are 10 people with r/w access to a repository
                    that contains ~500 .doc &amp; .xls files that make up the
                    requirements and configuration documents for one particular
                    content delivery platform.  I also use it for my personal
                    PHP application development.  We have used every access
                    protocol except svn+ssh and https.  Currently we are
                    preparing to migrate from svn to http to make use of SSPI
                    authentication (a huge plus).<br/>
                    I fully expect to extend T/SVN across all business
                    units for systems analysis and we expect the Java web
                    application development team for the aforementioned
                    business unit to migrate from CVS to SVN as soon as they
                    get time, allowing us to store requirements and code in
                    the same place.<br/>
                    As for issues with TSVN, we don't really have any. In
                    short, I'm a huge advocate for TSVN and feel like this is
                    one of the cleanest, most well run open source projects
                    available.

                    I'm one of about 20 developers who work on various projects
                    ranging from GUI clients to integration with telephones
                    (PBX). Our projects are mainly varius text source files
                    (Delphi, HTML, XML, JavaScript, Java, Python etc) and
                    number of source files per project is from 20 to >1500.<br/><br/>
                    We have used CVS but there were many problems with this.
                    Especially if you work on Windows and try to compile on
                    Linux, and Delphi IDE sometimes changes case in your
                    library filename :( In svn there is less problems because
                    of pre-commit hook. It is also easier to use repository.
                    Simple CGI program can show links to repositories.  In
                    CSV it is much harder.  We use https protocol. I have
                    also created Trac environments (see http://trac.edgewall.org/)
                    for bigger projects.  So much on svn.<br/>
                    I like TSVN because it integrates with Windows shell.
                    We use TotalCommander and it co-operates very well with
                    TSVN. With CVS we used WinCvs, but it was much harder to
                    use.  TortoiseCVS was better, but problems with CVS lead
                    us to Subversion+TSVN.<br/><br/>
                    Things I like in TSVN:<br/>
                    + integration works very well with TotalCommander<br/>
                    + nice commit dialog where I can sort by extension (not
                    possible in WinCVS)<br/>
                    + integrated spellchecker (even for my language: Polish)<br/>
                    + very good and really fast support on TSVNdev list

                    I use TortoiseSVN both at work, and generally -- I keep my
                    home directory under Subversion and on Windows I use
                    TortoiseSVN to keep local copies up to date (since I use
                    many different machines, and really really want all my
                    goodies present on each -- see
                    <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/06/svn_homedir.html">http://www.onlamp.com/pu...svn_homedir.html</a>
                    for a whole essay about this).<br/>
                    At work, there are perhaps 10 people who use svn at all;
                    I'd guess at least half use TortoiseSVN.  As you might
                    guess, many of those people are uncomfortable with the
                    Windows command line; I wouldn't be surprised if a few
                    didn't even know it existed.<br/>
                    For accessing my home machine, I use svn+ssh, since I
                    don't want to expose my home machine to any other server
                    besides SSH (well, I guess I could use svn over http, but
                    I'm too lazy to learn how to configure Apache).  As far as
                    I know, TortoiseSVN is the only Windows svn client that
                    doesn't need anything extra installed to use svn+ssh,
                    since it comes with TortoisePlink.  (However, I still use
                    pageant, and can't imagine anyone not using it).<br/>
                    I've tried every svn GUI client out there.  There really
                    is no comparison: TortoiseSVN is brilliantly designed; the
                    UI is smooth and _almost_ intuitive; it's _maintained_; you
                    can talk to the developers; it's the opposite of
                    abandonware... more incoherent ranting about the<br/>
                    failings of every other GUI client can be found at

                    <blockquote><div>
                    I work at a small Russian software development company, we
                    have about two dozen programmers and a few non-programmers
                    (managers, marketing etc.) all using TSVN quite
                    successfully. Our repository predominantly contains code,
                    but have some binary files like Word documents, graphics
                    etc. The policy is to discourage such files.<br/>
                    Our projects are of moderate size, usually 500 to 2000
                    files, 10 to 100 Mb total size per project. All projects
                    are located in a common repository, with many files svn-copied
                    between projects. Whole setup works very well in both
                    performance and reliability.<br/>
                    We were using ClearCase before... need I say more?
                    TortoiseSVN is far better in every aspect.<br/>
                    Almost everything which I do not like is not TSVN's,
                    but Subversion's fault. I think SVN+TSVN is the ultimate
                    in evolution of centralized version control systems, and
                    the only reason to abandon them is moving to a distributed
                    development.

                    <blockquote><div>
                    My job is to construct and code firmware for the electronic
                    devices that our company produces. These projects are not
                    so big, but are many. Many years I used well known winzip
                    to maintain version control and was successful in this...
                    but while the project count was small.<br/>
                    Then this became impossible and I began to search for
                    version control system. I did know about CVS and also have
                    read that SVN is its successor. So I chose SVN. Well, I
                    did read documentation and the SVN book, I liked it, but
                    what I hate is the long command lines. So, I took the
                    final decision for SVN after I did found GUI client. I
                    find TSVN very intuitive with very quick access to all
                    commands. Without GUI client it will take more time to
                    enter in the SVN itself.<br/>
                    Other thing that I use is bugtracking system Flyspray.
                    I managed to integrate TSVN with Flyspray. Now I have
                    better, better control over the software process. It
                    sometimes happens to update several projects in day and I
                    do not lose the control. And at last I use blog system
                    Serendipity to write the chronology of my projects.
