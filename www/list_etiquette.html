<h1>TortoiseSVN Mailing Lists</h1>

<h2>Mailing List Etiquette</h2>

<p>A little bit of common sense should make it unneccessary to place this 
etiquette here, but since many people don't seem to know some basic rules... 
<div class="alert">
Here they are:
<ul>
<li>Answers go only to the mailing-list. If you don't want to subscribe to the
    list, you can read the answers in the archives (see below) or ask that the
    answers get CC'ed to you directly.</li>
<li>Don't mail the project owners directly. We are going to ditch these mails.</li>
<li>Answer below the quote.</li>
<li>Delete unnecessary text (signatures) in the quote.</li>
<li>No full quoting. Keep just enough of the original text so that others can
see the questions you are answering.</li>
<li>If you want to change to a different topic, create a new thread.
Don't just answer another message and replace the subject.</li>
<li>Limited text length per line (e.g. max. 72 characters).</li>
<li>No html or rtf mails</li>
<li>No big (larger than 10kB) attachments. Screenshots are ok, but send them as
    jpeg's or png's. Some people sent us screenshots in a WORD document - don't
    expect anyone to even open such a document.</li>
<li>Don't ask for mail receipts.</li>
<li>Don't send "out-of-office" replies or other autoresponder messages to the list.</li>
</ul>

If you are requesting a new feature or reporting a bug, take a look in our
<a href="http://tortoisesvn.berlios.de/issues/index.php?order=id&sort=desc&status=all">issue tracker</a>
first to see if someone else got there before you.
<br>
Now you're ready to ask questions on our <a href="mailto:users@tortoisesvn.tigris.org">mailing list</a>.
<br>
To subscribe/unsubscribe our different mailing lists see <a href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
To subscribe to our users mailing list, send an email to users-subscribe@tortoisesvn.tigris.org.
<br>
To unsubscribe, send an email to users-unsubscribe@tortoisesvn.tigris.org.
</p>
<p class="infomark">Please note that our mailing lists are moderated. That means that if you're not subscribed to the
list, your mail will not show up on the list until our moderators have reviewed your mail. This is done to avoid SPAM
on the list. So be patient, it may take some time, but your mail will show up on the list.</p>
<p>
If your company attaches a so called disclaimer to every mail, please contact your
IT department and ask them to remove it. If you don't know how to convince them, just ask them to
replace the disclaimer with this one:
</p>
<p>
<i>
We don't know how to use the security and encryption features of
our e-mail server.  We are so confused that we cannot even be
certain that this e-mail was delivered to the proper person.  So,
if you received this e-mail because of our incompetence, please
delete it and notify us as soon as possible.  Notice that this is
being written in the most scary legalistic way, so no one notices
how incompetent we are.
