<!-- The class h2 is included on the main div, because the HTML which the
     server will wrap around the page includes a <div class="h2">.
     Thus, we include one here so that the page looks right when previewed
     locally, *but* we override the border which the CSS assigns to that
     style, so that we do not get two borders on the live page. -->

	<h2>Mailing List Etiquette</h2>
	
	<p>A little bit of common sense should make it unneccessary to place this 
	etiquette here, but since many people don't seem to know some basic rules... 
	<div class="alert">
	Here they are:
	<ul>
	<li>Answers go only to the mailing-list. Do not answer to people directly.</li>
	<li>Don't mail the project owners directly. We are going to ditch these mails.</li>
	<li>Answer below the quote.</li>
	<li>Delete unnecessary text (signatures) in the quote.</li>
	<li>No full quoting. Keep just enough of the original text so that others can
	see the questions you are answering.</li>
	<li>If you want to change to a different topic, create a new thread.
	Don't just answer another message and replace the subject.</li>
	<li>No big (larger than 50kB) attachments. Screenshots are ok, but send them as
		jpeg's or png's. Some people sent us screenshots in a WORD document (!) - don't
		expect anyone to even open such a document.</li>
	<li>Don't ask for mail receipts.</li>
	<li>Don't send "out-of-office" replies or other autoresponder messages to the list.</li>
	</ul>
	for further reading see: 
	<ul>
	<li><a href="http://learn.to/quote">How To Quote</a>.</li>

	Thanks.

	<h3>Note about e-Mail disclaimers</h3>
	<p>
	If your company attaches a so called disclaimer to every mail, please contact your
	IT department and ask them to remove it. If you don't know how to convince them, just ask them to
	replace the disclaimer with this one:
	</p>
	<p>
	<i>
	We don't know how to use the security and encryption features of
	our e-mail server.  We are so confused that we cannot even be
	certain that this e-mail was delivered to the proper person.  So,
	if you received this e-mail because of our incompetence, please
	delete it and notify us as soon as possible.  Notice that this is
	being written in the most scary legalistic way, so no one notices
	how incompetent we are.
	</i>
	</p>
	<p>
	In case the above disclaimer doesn't convince your IT staff
	and/or boss(es), here's <em>my</em> disclaimer. I won't attach it to
	every mail I send, I put it here so you know what I would use as my
	disclaimer if it weren't so annoying to read them in every mail:
	</p>
	<i>
	By sending an email to ANY of my addresses you are agreeing that:
	<ol>
		<li>I am by definition, "the intended recipient"</li>
		<li>All information in the email is mine to do with as I see fit and make such 
			financial profit, political mileage, or good joke as it lends itself to. 
			In particular, I may quote it on usenet.</li>
		<li>I may take the contents as representing the views of your company.</li>
		<li>This overrides any disclaimer or statement of confidentiality that may be included on your message.</li>
	</ol>
	</i>
	<p>
	Oh, and don't be surprised if we send your mail (including the disclaimer of course) to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk">the register</a>
	for their next <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/05/18/readers_letters_the_email_disclaimer/">Email Disclaimer Awards</a>.
