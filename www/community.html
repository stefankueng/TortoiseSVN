                    <p>We use <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewForums.do">mailing lists</a> 
                    to discuss everything about TortoiseSVN. Everyone is 
                    welcome to join our discussions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How to join the mailing lists</h3>

                    <p>We have two mailing lists for discussions:</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>users list</dt>
                        <dd>
                        <p>This is the list for the users of TortoiseSVN. If 
                        you have questions, suggestions or you want to report 
                        a bug, join here.</p>
                        <p>To join the users mailing list, send an email to 
                        <nobr>users-subscribe@tortoisesvn.tigris.org.</nobr></p>
                        <p>Or use the 
                        <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=4061">Forum</a> 
                        to read and post (you need to create a tigris.org 
                        account).</p>

                        </dd>
                        <dt>developers list</dt>
                        <dd>
                        <p>Here, the developers discuss technical details about 
                        new features. If you want to join the development of 
                        TortoiseSVN, join here! This is also the place where 
                        users of the <a href="http://nightlybuilds.tortoisesvn.net/">nightly builds</a> 
                        report issues.</p>
                        <p><b>If you're not sure about where you should join, 
                        use the users list instead.</b></p>
                        <p>To join the developers mailing list, send an email 
                        to <nobr>dev-subscribe@tortoisesvn.tigris.org.</nobr></p>
                        <p>Or use the 
                        <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=757">Forum</a> 
                        to read and post.</p>
                        </dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>Note: if your posts to the lists get rejected even if 
                    you're subscribed, you have to create an account on 
                    <a href="http://www.tigris.org">tigris.org</a> and assign 
                    the email address from which you're posting to that account. 
                    In some situations it might even be necessary that you 
                    request the "observer" role in the TortoiseSVN project on 
                    tigris.org. We know the problems, and the guys at 
                    tigris.org are working on it.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Mailing List Etiquette</h3>
                    <p>A little bit of common sense should make it unnecessary 
                    to place this etiquette here, but since many people don't 
                    seem to know some basic rules...</p>
                    <div class="alert">
                    Here they are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Answers go only to the mailing-list. Do not answer 
                        to people directly.</li>
                        <li>Don't mail the project owners directly. We are 
                        going to ditch these mails.</li>
                        <li>Answer below the quote.</li>
                        <li>Delete unnecessary text (signatures) in the quote.</li>
                        <li>No full quoting. Keep just enough of the original 
                        text so that others can see the questions you are 
                        answering.</li>
                        <li>If you want to change to a different topic, create 
                        a new thread. Don't just answer another message and 
                        replace the subject.</li>
                        <li>No big (larger than 50kB) attachments. Screenshots 
                        are ok, but send them as jpeg's or png's. Some people 
                        sent us screenshots in a WORD document (!) - don't 
                        expect anyone to even open such a document.</li>
                        <li>Don't ask for mail receipts.</li>
                        <li>Don't send "out-of-office" replies or other 
                        autoresponder messages to the list.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>for further reading see:</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Thanks.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Mailing list archives</h3>
                    <p>before you start asking question on the mailing lists, 
                    you should first search the mailing list archives. There's 
                    a big chance that you're not the first one with that 
                    question, and it might already been answered before.</p>

                    <p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>users list</dt>
                        <dd>either search on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/tortoisesvn">Google Group</a> or the <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=4061">tigris.org</a> websites.</dd>
                        <dt>developers list</dt>
                        <dd>either search on <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/tortoisesvn-dev">Google Group</a> or the <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewForumSummary.do?dsForumId=757">tigris.org</a> websites.</dd>
                    </dl>
                    </p>
                    <p>Note: Messages on the Google Group have options to 
                    <i>Reply</i> or <i>Reply to Author</i>. 
                    Please do <b>not</b> use the <i>Reply to Author</i> option 
                    as it will not get back to the mailing list and may 
                    simply be deleted. Some older posts do not have a 
                    standard <i>Reply</i> option. In that case you should at 
                    least add a <i>CC</i> to our mailing list 
                    <nobr>(users at tortoisesvn dot tigris dot org).</nobr></p>

                    <h3>Professional Support</h3>
                    <p>A lot of companies also offer professional support. 
                    Two of them are also active in the development of 
                    Subversion itself and have hired developers who work 
                    actively on the projects. So they know what they're 
                    supporting and can actually help you:</p>
