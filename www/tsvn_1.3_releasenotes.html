                <h2>What's New in TortoiseSVN 1.3</h2>

                <p>TortoiseSVN 1.3 is a superset of all previous TortoiseSVN releases.
                Anything in 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 1.2.x is also in 1.3, but 1.3 contains
                features and bugfixes not present in any earlier release. It is
                linked with Subversion 1.3.</p>

                <ul>
                   <li><p>The "<strong>_svn</strong>" hack is now officially
                       supported: since some versions of ASP.NET don't allow
                       directories beginning with dot (e.g., ".svn", the standard
                       Subversion working copy administrative directory), TortoiseSVN
                       now treats the environment variable SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK
                       specially. If this variable is set (to any value), it will
                       use "_svn" instead of ".svn". Note that once the environment
                       variable is set, working copies with standard ".svn" directories
                       will stop working, and will need to be re-checked-out to get "_svn"
                       instead.</p>

                       <p class="infomark">After you've set the environment variable,
                       you must restart the shell for the changes to take effect.</p>
                   </li>

                   <li><p>During http:// and https:// transfers, TortoiseSVN now
                       shows information about the transferred data (transfer speed,
                       bytes transferred).</p>
                   </li>

                   <li>
                       The shell context menu now has key accelerators for better
                       use with the keyboard.
                   </li>

                   <li>
                       The revision graph has been redesigned to make it easier to read,
                       and to show complex branching more reliably.
                   </li>

                   <li>
                       Colours used in TortoiseSVN are configurable in the settings dialog.
                   </li>

                   <li>
                       The log dialog has a new column, showing icons for the type of changes
                       which were made in a revision.
                   </li>

                   <li>
                       TortoiseMerge supports sideways scrolling using the keyboard.
                   </li>

                   <li>
                       For companies, the URL where TortoiseSVN checks if updates are
                       available can be configured to point e.g. to the companys own
                       website. Just enter the URL in the registry key <code>HKCU\Software\TortoiseSVN\UpdateCheckURL</code>.
                   </li>

                   <li>
                       Many many more small improvements and bug fixes.
                       See the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/source/browse/tags/version_1.3.0/src/Changelog.txt">Change Log</a> for full details.
                   </li>

                <h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

                <p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.3
                servers and clients.  Of course, some of the new 1.3 features may not
                be available unless both client and server are the latest version.
                There is <strong>no need</strong> to upgrade your repositories;
                </p>

                <p>If you access a BDB repository using <code>file://</code> access
                you will need to update that repository to BDB 4.3 format. But this is
                only necessary if you're upgrading from a TortoiseSVN version before
                1.2.
                Instructions on how to do that can be found on the
                <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#bdb43-upgrade">
