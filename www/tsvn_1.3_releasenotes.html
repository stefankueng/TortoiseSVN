<h2>What's New in TortoiseSVN 1.3</h2>

<p>TortoiseSVN 1.3 is a superset of all previous TortoiseSVN releases.
Anything in 1.0.x, 1.1.x, or 1.2.x is also in 1.3, but 1.3 contains
features and bugfixes not present in any earlier release. It is
linked with Subversion 1.3.</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>Interruptable http:// and https:// connections. TortoiseSVN
          can be interrupted during network operations over http 
          and https.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>The "<b>_svn</b>" hack is now officially
       supported: since some versions of ASP.NET don't allow
       directories beginning with dot (e.g., ".svn", the standard
       Subversion working copy administrative directory), TortoiseSVN
       now treats the environment variable SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK
       specially. If this variable is set (to any value), it will
       use "_svn" instead of ".svn". Note that once the environment
       variable is set, working copies with standard ".svn" directories
       will stop working, and will need to be re-checked-out to get "_svn"
       instead.</p>

       <p class="infomark">After you've set the environment variable,
       you must restart the shell for the changes to take effect.</p>

       <p class="todo"><i>TODO: Adjust the FAQ once 1.3 is released.</i></p>
   </li>

   <li><p>During http:// and https:// transfers, TortoiseSVN now
       shows information about the transferred data (transfer speed,
       bytes transferred).</p>
       <p class="todo"><i>TODO: This is not implemented yet</i></p>
   </li>
   
   <li><p>TortoiseSVN can now authenticate against apache based
       repositories with SSPI automatically. That means you don't have
       to enter username/passwords anymore but TortoiseSVN automatically
       authenticates with your windows login data.</p>
       
       <p class="todo"><i>TODO: Adjust the 
       <a href="http://tortoisesvn.berlios.de/?q=node/89">FAQ</a> once
       1.3 is released.</p>
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.3
servers and clients.  Of course, some of the new 1.3 features may not
be available unless both client and server are the latest version.
There is <strong>no need</strong> to upgrade your repositories;
Subversion 1.3 can read repositories created by earlier versions.  To
upgrade an existing installation, just install the newest libraries
and binaries on top of the older ones. (<em>WARNING:</em> if you're
using Berkeley DB repositories, installing a new binary distribution
of Subversion may force you to upgrade Berkeley DB as well, see
<a href="#bdb-upgrade">Unexpected Berkeley DB Upgrades</a> below.)</p>

<h3>Unexpected Berkeley DB Upgrades</h3>

<p>This is not actually related to the Subversion 1.3 release, but it
may affect you if you upgrade to 1.3 via a package distribution
system.</p>

<p>A lot of operating systems now ship Berkeley DB 4.3.  Sometimes the
system Berkeley DB libraries can be unintentionally upgraded to 4.3 as
part of some other change pulled down via an OS package delivery
mechanism&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;for example, upgrading one's Subversion
package.  If this happens to you, you will need
to <a href="faq.html#bdb43-upgrade">upgrade existing BerkeleyDB-based
repositories to 4.3.</a></p>

<p>Since Version 1.2, TortoiseSVN
uses Berkeley DB 4.3.  If you are upgrading from an older version, the
above may be of concern to you.</p>
