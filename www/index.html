                    <p>Subversion's design is made up so that you will
                    never ever lose any data. But there's one command
                    that will do exactly that: <b>Revert</b>. <br/>
                    Reverting means discarding all modifications you've
                    made to one or more files which you haven't committed
                    yet.</p>
                    <p>But what if you selected the wrong file(s) to revert?
                    Sure, TortoiseSVN always asks you first before it
                    reverts the files. But as we all know, such &quot;Are you sure?&quot;
                    dialogs are too easily dismissed by clicking &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>
                    <p>So what if you reverted files and you then discover
                    that you shouldn't have done that?<br />

                    We're proud to announce that TortoiseSVN 1.7.9 has been released.
                    It is linked against Subversion 1.7.6
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Well, we messed up the last release: there was a bug
                    that caused other applications to crash. And since
                    we try to play nice we're releasing a new version.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    There are a few other minor bugs fixed as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We recommend that you update to this version as soon as possible.
                    You can get it from our <a href="/downloads.html">download page</a>.

                <div class="storycontent">
                    <p>The revision graph is a nice way to get a quick
                    overview of your project. However you can not share
                    the graph with other people unless you save it as
                    an image and pass the image on.</p>
                    <p>If the revision graph is small, then saving the
                    graph as a png image will do just fine. But as with
                    all images, a png does not scale very well. And if the
                    revision graph is already big the resulting image file
                    can get quite big as well. It can even get too big
                    to show.</p>

                    &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="http://tools.tortoisesvn.net/AAClr.html" class="permalink">Full article</a></p>
                <div class="entry">
                    <p>Windows 8 (or whatever its name will be when it's released)
                    will have a new feature where the Aero colors can be 
                    <a href="http://www.withinwindows.com/2011/04/06/windows-8-secrets-aero-auto-colorization/">
                    automatically adjusted according to the selected wallpaper</a>.</p>
                    <p>This seems to be a nice feature, and there's even a tool available
                    that offers that feature for Windows 7: <a href="http://aura.codeplex.com/">Aura</a>.</p>
                    <p>But there are some things about Aura that bother me, so I hacked together
                    my own tool which offers that feature.</p>
                    <p>Unlike Aura, AAClr is written in plain C++ and doesn't 
                    use the .NET framework. For tools that are supposed to be started
                    automatically on logon, this ensures that the whole startup time
                    doesn't increase by several seconds.</p>
                    <p>AAClr also detects changes in wallpapers by catching events
                    from the system and doesn't use timers that access the wallpaper file
                    several times a second (like Aura does). That means that AAClr is idle
                    most of the time and only wakes up when necessary.</p>
                    <p>And about resource usage: AAClr uses less than 2MB of 
                    private bytes - I think that's not too much.</p>
                    <p>The link to the download can be found on the <a href="http://tools.tortoisesvn.net/AAClr.html">project page</a>.</p>

                    There's now a <a href="http://link.packtpub.com/qcmkxs">book</a> available about TortoiseSVN. Of course, 
                    there are books about Subversion which mention TortoiseSVN.
                    But this is (I think) the first book about TortoiseSVN.

                    Full disclosure: I was asked to <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/author_reviewing_for_packt">review</a>
                    the book, which I did. And I'm mentioned as a reviewer in
                    the book! So I had to write something about it here since
                    I was never mentioned in a book before :).
