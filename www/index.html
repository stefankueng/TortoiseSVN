		<p>	TortoiseSVN is a <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org" target="top_">Subversion</a> client, implemented as a windows shell extension.
		The coolest Interface to (Sub)Version Control.</p>

		<p> TortoiseSVN is a really easy-to-use version control / source control client under a GPL license, i.e. it's free! <br />
		    Since it's not an integration for a <em>specific</em> IDE you can use it with whatever development tools you like. </p>

				<ul>

				</ul>
			<li>Available in many languages</li>
			<li>TortoiseSVN is stable</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Before every release, we create one or more 'release candidates' for adventurous people to test first.</li>
					<li>During development cycles, many people test intermediate builds. These are built every night automatically
					    and made available to all our users. This helps finding bugs very early so they won't even get into an
					    official release.</li>
					<li>A big user community helps out with testing each build before we release it.</li>
					<li>A custom crash report tool is included in every TortoiseSVN release which helps us fix the bugs
					    much faster, even if you can't remember exactly what you did to trigger it.</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>Extensive and descriptive <a href="http://tortoisesvn.sourceforge.net/doc_release">documentation</a>
					   is available in several formats and languages</li>

					   and problems with all the answers is also available</li>
