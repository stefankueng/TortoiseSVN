                    <p>
                    in a few weeks, Subversion 1.7 will be officially released. 
                    This means that TortoiseSVN 1.7 will be released only a few days later. 
                    Now it's high time to polish up our translations and finish as many of them as possible.
                    In most cases the biggest item on the to-do list is the TortoiseSVN manual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    There are five translations where the GUI translation is almost finished and the manual
                    is more than 90% done.
                    These are: 
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/nl/">Dutch</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/fr/">French</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/ja/">Japanese</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/ru/">Russian</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/es/">Spanish</a>.
                    If at least two volunteers help, we should be able to deliver a 100% complete translation for these languages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Close behind are:
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/zh_CN/">Chinese</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/sl/">Slovenian</a>.
                    Their manuals are > 70% finished, but this is going to be a tough job to get it done. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Then we have the 
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/id/">Indonesian</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/pl/">Polish</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/pt_BR/">Portuguese (Brazil)</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/r/release-1-7-0/l/sk/">Slovak</a>
                    manuals, which are between 40% and 60% done. It would be cool to get close to 100%, 
                    but a lot of work to achieve this goal. The Polish translator is currently very active 
                    and would surely appreciate any help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Finally there are several languages where no manual exists, but the GUI translation 
                    is >70% complete. See the <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/tortoisesvn/resource/trunk-gui/">GUI translation statistics</a>.
                    These are the easiest jobs to finish, because the GUI translation 
                    doesn't have long paragraphs, but many single words or short sentences to translate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Please come and help. We need *you* :) Some information on how to join the translation
                    team is available on our <a href="translation.html">translation page</a>.

                    <p>TortoiseSVN 1.6.16 has been released.</p>
                    <p>This is a bugfix release/maintenance release,  
                    linked with Subversion 1.6.17.</p>
                    <p>Subversion 1.6.17 also contains a few security related
                    fixes:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Note: these vulnerabilities only refer to Subversion
                    servers, not clients. Which means TortoiseSVN is not affected
                    by those.</p>
                    <p>We still recommend that you update your TortoiseSVN client to 
                    this latest version. You can get it from our 
                    <a href="/downloads.html">download</a> page.</p>
                    <p>Also note that if you upgrade from a version before 
                    1.6.10, you have to run a repair install after the upgrade. 
                    To do that, run the installer again and click the "Repair" 
                    button. I'm sorry about the inconvenience.</p>
                    <p>If you want to know why the repair install is required, 
                    you can read about the technical details in my

                    <p>Windows 8 (or whatever its name will be when it's released)
                    will have a new feature where the Aero colors can be 
                    <a href="http://www.withinwindows.com/2011/04/06/windows-8-secrets-aero-auto-colorization/">
                    automatically adjusted according to the selected wallpaper</a>.</p>
                    <p>This seems to be a nice feature, and there's even a tool available
                    that offers that feature for Windows 7: <a href="http://aura.codeplex.com/">Aura</a>.</p>
                    <p>But there are some things about Aura that bother me, so I hacked together
                    my own tool which offers that feature.</p>
                    <p>Unlike Aura, AAClr is written in plain C++ and doesn't 
                    use the .NET framework. For tools that are supposed to be started
                    automatically on logon, this ensures that the whole startup time
                    doesn't increase by several seconds.</p>
                    <p>AAClr also detects changes in wallpapers by catching events
                    from the system and doesn't use timers that access the wallpaper file
                    several times a second (like Aura does). That means that AAClr is idle
                    most of the time and only wakes up when necessary.</p>
                    <p>And about resource usage: AAClr uses less than 2MB of 
                    private bytes - I think that's not too much.</p>
                    <p>The link to the download can be found on the <a href="http://tools.tortoisesvn.net/AAClr.html">project page</a>.</p>

                users asked me whether TortoiseSVN 1.7 would provide a way to
                customize the context menu entries, so that he could remove
                certain entries/commands for certain users.</p>

                    There's now a <a href="http://link.packtpub.com/qcmkxs">book</a> available about TortoiseSVN. Of course, 
                    there are books about Subversion which mention TortoiseSVN.
                    But this is (I think) the first book about TortoiseSVN.

                    Full disclosure: I was asked to <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/article/author_reviewing_for_packt">review</a>
                    the book, which I did. And I'm mentioned as a reviewer in
                    the book! So I had to write something about it here since
                    I was never mentioned in a book before :).
