<h3>Installation issues</h3>
<h4><a name="whydonticonsappear">Why don't the icon overlays appear?</a></h4>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" width="99%" bgcolor="white">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="100%" height="100" bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
<ul>
<li>If you are using Windows 95 the icon overlays won't appear.  You can try the instructions
for Windows NT4 below if you like, but it may still not work.
<li>If you are using Windows NT4, you need to
install the IE4 shell or desktop extensions to get a more recent version
of Explorer.

To do this install IE4, and choose Yes to install the active desktop.
Don't worry, you can turn off the actual active desktop later by right
clicking on it.  It's the new version of Explorer that we are after.

<p>If you've already installed IE5, you must either: <ol> <li>Uninstall
IE5 and then install IE4 with desktop extensions, and then install IE5
again. What a palaver.  <li>Run IE5 setup with command line switches to
install the IE4 desktop (shell) extensions.  This may cause problems, <a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&safe=off&th=a141d6286e4b302a,4&seekm=OlDwT17y%24GA.280%40cppssbbsa04#p">read
this usenet thread</a> for the source of this information.  <p>The
command must be run from the folder that contains the ie5setup.exe file.
If the browser appears unstable afterwards just run the IE5 repair function.

<p>For Win95: ie5setup.exe /c:"ie5wzd /e:IE4Shell WIN /I:Y"

<p>For WinNT: ie5setup.exe /c:"ie5wzd /e:IE4Shell NTx86 /I:Y" </ol>

<p>For IE6: <ol> <li>Run IE6 setup with command line switches to install
the IE4 desktop (shell) extensions. The same caveats apply as for IE5.
<p>The command must be run from the folder that contains the
ie6setup.exe file.

<p>For WinNT: ie6setup.exe /c:"ie6wzd /e:IE4Shell NTx86 /I:Y" </ol>

<p>The shortcut labelled Win NT Explorer on your start
menu probably points to <tt>C:\WINNT\explorer.scf</tt> and
<b>doesn't</b> get the overlays.  <p>Create a new shortcut to
<br><tt>%windir%\Explorer.exe /n, /e</tt> <br>and it may get the overlays.

<li>If you're using an IntelliPoint mouse driver, and launching Explorer
via a mouse click, you need to upgrade from version 3 to version 3.2 of
IntelliPoint.  Strangely, launching Explorer from the Start menu gives
icons in this case, but not when launched from the mouse.

The Windows icon cache is a fairly buggy creature. You can solve this in one of the following ways:
<ul> <li>Install Microsoft's <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/downloads/powertoys/networking/nttweakui.asp">TweakUI</a>
and run the option to rebuild icons.  <li>Or increase the icon cache size. Go to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer and
add a new String Value called "Max Cached Icons". The default value is 500 -
try increasing it to 2048 (see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q132/6/68.asp">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q132/6/68.asp</a> for more details).  <li>Or delete the file called ShellIconCache
in your Windows directory.  And reboot.

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" width="99%" bgcolor="white">

<td width="100%" height="100" bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
You can create your own icon set if you want. And if you do please
contribute them to the rest of the world!
<p>The icons should have at least two sizes (16x16 and 32x32 with 16 colors), for
Windows XP there should also be a set with 48x48 pixels</p>
<p>to install the icons you should copy them to the directory where
TortoiseSVN was installed. There you can either replace the existing icons or give them
new names. If you choose not to overwrite the original ones then you also need to tweak
some registry settings. Under HKLM\Software\TortoiseSVN\ change the keys ConflictIcon, InSubversionIcon and ModifiedIcon
to the path and names of your own icon set.</p>
<p>after that you need to restart (or logoff) your computer so that explorer reads
in the icons again. Alternatively you can flush the icon cache with the
<a href=http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/downloads/powertoys/networking/nttweakui.asp>TweakUI</a>
tool from Microsoft. For WinXP you can get it <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp>here</a></p>

The TSVN menu is missing when nothing is selected!<br>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" width="99%" bgcolor="white">

<td width="100%" height="100" bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
<p>This is because the icons are completely ownerdrawn. The main menu is known
to disappear under windows 98, ME, NT and 2000. Everything works fine under XP</p>
<p>I you don't like the way TSVN handles it's menu entries, you can do the following:<br>
Just create a (DWORD) registry entry under: 
<pre>
HKCU\Software\TortoiseSVN\OwnerdrawnMenus
</pre>
and set it to 0<br> This will force TSVN to use the windows standard routine to draw
menu entries. You'll have all the menu entries any time, but you will have ugly icons,
since windows default only allows 10x10 icons.
If you delete this registry key (the default) or set it to something else than 0 
you have the nice icons back.

Easy, you commit the whole directory!  Right click
in the Explorer window next to the file, and choose commit.  I nearly
always commit things from the top level directory - it is recursive
through the whole project.

<td width="100%" height="100" bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
There's nothing wrong with it. Subversion only allows to check out directories.
A warning is not possible because TSVN has no possibility to check if a URL
(e.g. http://svn.collab.net/svn/repos/trunk/README) is a file or a folder. But
subversion itself complains if it's a file....

Follow those steps:

<li>Rename from "UPPERCASE" to "UPPERCASE_"</li>
<li>Commit the changes</li>
<li>Rename from "UPPERCASE_" to "lowercase"</li>
<li>Commit the changes</li>
</ul> 
That way you won't loose the log-history of the file.
Just remember to rename it "within" subversion, i.e.
with the special rename command in the TSVN
submenu. Just renaming in the explorer will
corrupt your working copy.

<td width="100%" height="100" bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
Your're trying to fool subversion aren't you? Now seriously what did you expect to happen?<br>
Assume you're in revision #55.<br>
You removed a file using TSVN, which told it to <b>mark</b> the file for deletion with the next commit 
and to remove it from the explorer. It's not really gone from the revision yet. 
Then you created a file with the same name and added it to TSVN, which <b>marks</b> 
the file for adding with the next commit. It's not yet added to the repository.
Now you commit. Poor subversion tries to decide whether to add/remove your file 
at the same time in revision #56. The commit fails.<br>   
You should have committed immediately after you deleted the file using TSVN's remove command.<br>
You still have no clue what to do? Well, in that case:
<ul>
<li>Move that file to a safe place</li>
<li>Commit your changes. That tells the repository, that the file is gone in the first place</li>
<li>Copy the file back</li> 
<li>Commit again</li>

Yes, you can.  This is a standard feature
of SVN.  Each directory which was checked out of SVN remembers where it
came from. You can even multiply select working copies which came from
different places, and update or commit them all at once.
<p>If you want to have different subdirectories to come from different repositories
you can set a special Subversion property called <em>svn:externals</em>. Please
look at the chapter <a href=http://svnbook.red-bean.com/html-chunk/ch06s03.html>External Definitions</a>
in the <a href=http://svnbook.red-bean.com>Subversion Book</a>.

<td width="100%" height="100" bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
Imagine you check out revision 24 of a file and started editing it. In the
meantime, someone else committed revision 25, and shortly after that
revision 26. You tell TortoiseSVN to update your file now, and SVN will try
to incorporate all the changes between revision 24 and 26 into your local
file.
<p>
But if the changes made between 24 and 26 were too close to or even
overlap with the changes you have made, SVN detects a conflict and creates
<em>conflict markers</em> in the file. Subversion also creates three
special files for every conflicted file:
<ol>
<li><em>filename.*.mine</em> This is your file as it existed in your working copy
before you updated your working copy - that is, without conflict markers.
This file has your latest changes in it and nothing else.
<li><em>filename.*.rOLDREV</em> This is the file that was the BASE revision
before you updated your working copy. That is, the file that you checked
out before you made your latest edits.
<li><em>filename.*.rNEWREV</em>This is the file that your Subversion client
just received from the server when you updated your working copy. This file
corresponds to the HEAD revision of the repository.
</ol>
At this point TortoiseSVN will not allow you to committ the conflicted file
until you <em>resolved</em> the conflict. To tell TortoiseSVN that you
resolved the conflict simply delete the three additional files or use
the command <em>resolve</em> to do that for you.

<p>TSVN uses Subversion. Nuff said :-)<br>
Seriously not, read the Subversion pages. You can screw up your working copy any 
way you like, but if you commit your data regularly, you can always revert
to a functional state. TSVN was not made to protect you against stupidity (e.g. Format C:).
</p>
<p>There is however one issue involved. TSVN is always built against the latest
subversion release. If the subversion team decides to change the database layout, 
then your TSVN client might not match your SVN repository and cause havoc.
In this case you have to migrate the repository first. Check the subversion book
on how to do this. <br>
TSVN currently has no way to determine the version of the repository it is 
accessing. This may become a feature of a post 1.0 subversion release.
