                        <h3>When upgrading TortoiseSVN, do I have to uninstall the existing version first?</h3>
                        <p>No. You can just install the new version over the old one. The installer will take
                        care of uninstalling the old version first automatically. But you must reboot your
                        computer after the installer finishes! Or at least you have to log off and log on again.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Do I need Admin privileges to install TortoiseSVN?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, you need to have Admin privileges to install TortoiseSVN, or at least
                        have the rights to install <em>with</em> Admin privileges.</p>
                        <p>But after TortoiseSVN has been installed, you can use it without having
                        Admin privileges.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="h3" id="installsubversion">
                        <h3>Do I need to install Subversion before I can use TortoiseSVN?</h3>
                        <p>No. TortoiseSVN comes with everything you need to access a repository.
                        Only if you want to set up a server then you will need the Subversion package.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="h3" id="uninstall">
                        <h3>How do I uninstall TortoiseSVN?</h3>
                        <p>Simply uninstall from Add/Remove Programs in the Windows control panel.
                        This does not affect your repositories or working copies at all.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>MSI installation is disabled on my machine. Is there a .exe installer?</h3>
                        <p>An exe installation file wouldn't help. If msi installation is really disabled
                        on your machine, then you don't have ADMIN privileges either. And you would need
                        those to install TortoiseSVN (shell extensions require ADMIN rights to install).
                        But first make sure that msi installation is really disabled - that can only be
                        if your domain administrator disabled it.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="h3" id="whymsi">
                        <h3>Why are you using MSI instead of an exe or no installer at all?</h3>
                        <p>There are several reasons why we use MSI as our installer instead of something else:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It's open. Everybody can see what we're doing by using msi tools like Orca.</li>
                            <li>It's easy to adjust an existing msi for your special needs if you like. There are tools with which you can edit an msi manually. You can't do that with an exe installer.</li>
                            <li>It runs with SYSTEM privileges, not just as e.g. Administrator. That's important because TortoiseSVN is a shell extension which requires us to create and modify registry keys which aren't accessible to user accounts (this is especially important on Vista with UAC enabled).</li>
                            <li>It's easy to distribute an msi to multiple computers/users in a domain via GPO's. All other installers would require a domain admin to first 'wrap' that installer inside an msi to do that.</li>
                            <li>msi is the standard and recommended way of installing windows applications. It's even <strong>required</strong> now to get the "Certified for Vista" logo from Microsoft.</li>
                            <li>There's a great open source tool for creating msi files: <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net">WiX</a> which we use.</li>
                            <li>msi takes care of reference counting of installed modules which prevents the so called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_hell">dll hell</a>.</li>
                            <li>an installer is required since we have to <strong>register</strong> TortoiseSVN with the shell. A simple exe for you to run wouldn't work.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </div>

                        <div class="h3" id="installerror">
                        <h3>The installer aborts with an error message</h3>
                        <p>There are several reasons why the installation cannot succeed:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>&quot;This installation package is not supported by this processor type. Contact your product vendor.&quot;</em> This means you are trying to install the 64-bit version of TortoiseSVN on a normal 32-bit operating system. You need to download and use the correct msi file for your OS. For normal 32-bit OS, make sure the msi file does not have an <em>x64</em> in it.</li>
                            <li><em>&quot;The installer was interrupted before TortoiseSVN could be installed. You need to restart the installer to try again&quot;</em>Then the user SYSTEM doesn't have read/execution rights in the folder where the installer msi is located. Either move the msi file to another location or give the user SYSTEM read and execution rights.</li>
                            <li><em>&quot;The windows installer service could not be accessed&quot;</em> This can occur if you are running Windows in safe mode, or if the windows installer is not correctly installed. For this kind of error message, please check out the Microsoft Knowledgebase article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q315346">Q315346</a> (basically, check that the folder where the msi is stored isn't encrypted or compressed)</li>
                            <li><em>&quot;The system can not open the device of file specified&quot;</em>, followed usually by <em>&quot;The installer has encountered an unexpected error installing this package. This may indicate a problem with this package. The error code is 2755&quot;</em>. This can happen if:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The installation does not have access to the Temp directory or if the default Temp directory of the machine is not clean or does not have enough space to run the setup.</li>
                                <li>The installation is being run over a terminal Server via a mapped network drive.</li>
                                <li>The installation is unable to create or write to the Installer directory in a Windows NT system environment.</li>
                                <li>The temp folder and/or the msi file is encrypted/compressed</li>
                            </ul>
                                To solve this problem, clear the temp folder, move the installer msi file to your local harddrive where the user SYSTEM has full access rights. The following knowledge base articles may help:

                        You may find that not all of these icons are used on your system. This is because
                        the number of overlays allowed by Windows is limited to 15. Windows uses 4 of
                        those, and the remaining 11 can be used by other applications. If you are also
                        using TortoiseCVS, then there are not enough overlay slots available, so
                        TortoiseSVN tries to be a "Good Citizen (TM)"? and limits its use of overlays
                        to give other apps a chance.</p>

                        <p>If your working copy is on a SUBST drive the icons might be mixed up.</p>
                        <p>The problem arises because the cache tries to fetch the status for two "different"
                        locations at the same time, but those locations are actually the same so there
                        are two status fetchings for the same working copy at the same time.</p>
                        <p>There is an easy way to solve this: just exclude the original path from
                        showing overlays (settings->icon overlays->exclude paths).</p>
                        <p>For example, if you have mapped \\station\folder\wc to g: then put "\\station\folder\wc*" as the exclude pattern.</p>
                        <p>Another way to make the overlays work is to set the "Status cache" setting from "Default" to "Shell".</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="h3" id="ovlwrong">
                        <h3>Why are the overlays showing the wrong status?</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes you find that the overlays don't reflect the real status of files
                        and/or folders. Usually, hitting the F5 key is enough to make the overlays appear
                        correctly (you might have to wait a few seconds until the cache has fetched the
                        status again).</p>
                        <p>The treeview on the left side of the explorer is a whole other story. It won't
                        update the overlays, no matter how many times you hit the F5 key. That's a problem
                        with the explorer and outside of TortoiseSVN's reach.</p>
                        <p>A short explanation: The treeview always shows the whole explorer tree,
                        including network drives and other namespace extensions. Since these can be very
                        slow (e.g. slow network drives), the explorer tree doesn't ask the overlay
                        extensions for updated overlays all the time. Even if you tell the explorer
                        that a folder has changed and it should update the overlays accordingly, it
                        doesn't do so. It first checks itself if the folder really has changed and only
                        updates the overlays if it thinks the folder really has changed.</p>
                        <p>Now, since the Subversion status of a folder has nothing to do with the folder
                        itself, the folder itself never really changes (only some file inside the .svn folder,
                        but not the folder itself), explorer therefore doesn't update the overlays.</p>
                        <p>There are some tricks and workarounds to make the explorer refresh the overlays
                        even on the left treeview, but those are tricks and workarounds, which
                        obviously don't work all the time.</p>
                        <p>There's one trick that usually works, but it is slow and TortoiseSVN can't
                        use that trick on-the-fly - it just would slow down the system too much. But you
                        can trigger that trick manually by executing the 'cleanup' command on the root of
                        your working copy. After the cleanup command has finished, you have to wait a
                        few seconds for the treeview to update the overlay icons.</p>

                        <p>
                        The Windows icon cache is a fairly buggy creature. You can solve this in one of the following ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Install Microsoft's <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/xp-downloads#2TC=featured">TweakUI</a> and run the option to rebuild icons.</li>
                            <li>Or increase the icon cache size. Go to <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer</code> and add a new String Value called <code>Max Cached Icons</code>. The default value is 500 - try increasing it to 2048 (see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q132/6/68.asp">Q132668</a> in the Microsoft knowledge base for more details). </li>
                            <li>Or delete the file called ShellIconCache in your Windows directory. And reboot.</li>
                            <li>With TortoiseSVN 1.3.0 and later, you can also rebuild the icon cache by calling TortoiseProc from the command line like this <code>TortoiseProc.exe /command:rebuildiconcache</code></li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                        To show such an overlay, TortoiseSVN would have to contact the repository every time the overlay is shown.
                        That would make explorer impossibly slow. Servers often take several seconds to respond,
                        sometimes minutes - do you really want explorer to hang while that takes place,
                        every time you open a versioned folder?</p>
                        <p>A fundamental design feature of TortoiseSVN is that the repository is never
                        contacted except when explicitly requested by one of the context menu items.
                        Even with that restriction, it is still hard work maintaining a fast response.</p>
                        <p>If you want to see which users have files locked in their working copies or which files need updating,
                        use the Check for Modifications dialog and click on the Check repository button.</p>

                        If I right click on 'nothing' then the CPU is OK. What is happening?</p>
                        <p>XP contains a known bug that causes the CPU usage to spike to 100 percent when
                        you access the context menu under certain configurations. This bug causes
                        file-copy operations to halt, network connections to slow, and streaming media
                        (e.g., audio, video) to become distorted. To work around this bug, you need to
                        disable the GUI's transition effects by performing the following steps:</p>
                        <ol>

                        <h3>Can I keep my repository on a network share instead of setting up a server?</h3>
                        <p>If you need multiple computers to access the repository, you can in theory create
                        an FSFS repository (<strong>but not a BDB repository</strong>) on a network share
                        and access it using file:// protocol.
                        In practice this is <strong>not</strong> recommended for four very good reasons:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>You are giving direct write access to all users, so they could accidentally
                            delete or corrupt the repository file system.</li>
                            <li>Not all network file sharing protocols support the locking that Subversion requires.
                            One day you will find your repository has been subtly corrupted.</li>
                            <li>You have to set the access permissions in just the right way.
                            SAMBA is particularly difficult in this respect.</li>
                            <li>If one person installs a newer version of the client which upgrades the repository
                            format, then everyone else will be unable to access the repository until they also
                            upgrade to the new client version.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>By far the best way is to set up a real server process (such as Apache or svnserve),
                        store the repository on a local filesystem which the server can access, and make the
                        repository server available over a network. It is easier than you might think.

                        <p>With a web browser: Yes</p>
                        <p>A lot of people would agree that the TSVN repository browser would be a much
                        more useful tool if you could just point it at your versioning server and it
                        would show you whatever available repositories it had. Same story, albeit to a
                        lesser degree, with the command-line 'svn' client. Doing a 'svn ls' or
                        equivalent and being able to see what repositories and projects are hosted on a
                        specific versioning system would be very useful.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, this is a limitation in the Subversion libraries that both the
                        command-line client and TortoiseSVN use. It does not have the capability to
                        arbitrarily enumerate repositories on a server.</p>
                        <p>Some might even argue that the lack of this feature is incitement for end
                        users to just jumble everything into one big repository, when it would be more
                        appropriate to split things up.</p>

                        <p>Yes, you can change from one client to another whenever you want. The clients
                        just control your working copy and the interaction between your working copy and
                        the repository. The metadata inside the working copies used by the different
                        clients is identical.</p>
                        <p>But you can only use different clients if they all use the same version of
                        the Subversion library. The version of the Subversion library that TortoiseSVN uses
                        is indicated in the filename of the installer, other clients have similar indications.
                        You have to make sure that those versions match each other in the first two digits.
                        For example, all clients using Subversion 1.6.x can be used together (the 'x' indicates
                        that this number is not relevant for compatibility).</p>
                        <p>You must also be sure that all the clients are built for the same OS.
                        Client compatibility is only guaranteed for a particular OS type and metadata
                        representations may differ. You must <em>not</em> use a native Windows client and
                        the Cygwin client on the same working copy. And if you share a working copy over a
                        network you must <em>not</em> use a Linux and a Windows client on the same working
                        copy.</p>

                        on the parent folder where you deleted the file or directory.</p>
                        <p>If you have already committed the deleted file, then you can use the repository
                        browser, change to the revision where the file still existed and then use the
                        command <cite>Copy to...</cite> from the context menu. Enter the path to your
                        working copy as the target and the deleted file will be copied from the
                        repository to your working copy.</p>
                        <p>You can also restore a deleted directory using this technique.</p>
                        <p>If, after the file / folder has been restored using this trick, the log
                        dialog doesn't show you the history of that file, don't worry. The history is
                        still there. If you copy a file in SVN you copy its history too. But the default
                        setting in TSVN's ShowLog is to 'Stop on copy', which means that when you look
                        at the history, it only goes back to the branch point. The reason for this is
                        that when you are looking at a real branch of a project, mostly you only want to
                        see the history of that branch. To see the whole history in ShowLog you need to
                        unselect the 'Stop on copy' checkbox and click on 'Get All'.</p>

                        This is by design. One entry is for the link itself (the .lnk-file), the other
                        for the target the link points to. This way a link can both be versioned and in
                        the same time work as a link should by allowing operations on its target.
                        In fact, you can have up to three entries in the file menu (the context menu

                        Yes, but with some limitations. You can use "File Externals" to pull in single files from a different
                        part of the same repository as your working copy, but not from a foreign repository.
                        You can also share folders, and these can be from any repository. Please

                        without user interaction (i.e. without having to enter username and password

                        <h3>How does the revision graph work?</h3>
                        <p>The revision graph is a little bit special, it's not like the other features
                        found in TortoiseSVN. It shows a graph of a file or folder through the history
                        with all the revision where the file or folder was copied, moved, branched or
                        tagged.</p>
                        <p>We often get people asking questions why it needs to get the log for the
                        repository root, or why it needs to get the full log from the HEAD revision
                        back down to the first revision.</p>
                        <p>Just to make this clear: this is not because we're lazy programmers, it really is necessary.</p>
                        <p>The revision graph shows the history of a selected file or folder by finding
                        all revisions where the selected item was copied. And the graph has to do that
                        by using the information that is available.</p>
                        <p>If you look at the log messages for your selected file or folder, you can see
                        in the lower pane of the log dialog all affected paths of the selected revision.
                        That information is what we use for the revision graph. You will also notice that
                        if you just show the log for e.g. /trunk, you won't see any entries in the log
                        dialog for revisions which happened in a tag or branch. You won't even see an
                        entry where you tagged or branched /trunk itself in that log.
                        --> that's why we must fetch the log for the repository root: only the log of
                        the repository root will give us all the information we need, including when
                        and where a path has been copied/branched/tagged/moved to.</p>
                        <p>If we would only fetch the log for a specific range and not all revisions,
                        we could miss the revision where (still using the example above with /trunk)
                        the trunk was branched or tagged. And even though there are changes to those
                        branches and tags or they still exist in the revision range, the graph could
                        not know that those branches/tags were made from /trunk and not from some other
                        path. That means, the graph would not just be incomplete, it would be wrong.</p>
                        <p>And no: we will never change that. Because there's nothing worse than a
                        graph that's only sometimes correct - you would never know when and if it is
                        correct, which means it would be worse than useless.</p>

                        won't even see the author who does the commit. So to tell Subversion an author
                        you have to specify the author in the URL itself. E.g.
                        svn+ssh://username@server.com. You should do that when you check out your working copy.

                        of the Subversion commands if your working copy is stored on a SAMBA share.</p>
                        <p>Some users reported that the problem went away after they upgraded SAMBA to the latest version.
                        If that does not help or you can't upgrade, allow readonly files to be deleted in the SAMBA config file:</p>

force security mode = 0600</pre>

                        <p>The information we have received suggests that the main problem is fixed in SAMBA 3.2.3.
                        There is a supplementary problem with making files with the svn:needs-lock property read-only.
                        This is reported to be fixed in SAMBA 3.2.6 or 3.3.0.</p>

                        <p>If you want to keep using TortoiseSVN and just prevent this from happening, you need to add '**/.svn/' to Eclipse's source exclude list.</p>

                        registry key <em>HKCU\Software\TortoiseSVN\OpenSSLCapi</em> as a DWORD

                        <h3>... change the case of a filename?</h3>
                        <p>Subversion is designed to work with case-sensitive file systems such as are
                        used on Linux. When it comes to the Windows case-insensitive file system, things
                        do not always run as you might expect. A case in point is renaming a file where
                        only the case changes, e.g. renaming Makefile to MAKEFILE. Prior to Subversion 1.7 you could not do this
                        easily within your working copy as Subversion required both names to exist
                        simultaneously for a short time, and Windows cannot support this.</p>
                        <p>By far the easiest way is to rename directly using the repository browser:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Commit the changes in your working copy.</li>
                            <li>Rename the file from UPPERcase to upperCASE directly in the repository using the repository browser.</li>
                            <li>Update your working copy.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>As of Subversion 1.7 this is no longer a problem as the whole working copy structure was changed,
                        so files can simply be renamed using the normal TSVN->Rename command.</p>

                        <p>As an example, have a look at the file <cite>version.in</cite> in the
                        <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/svn/tortoisesvn/trunk/src/version.in">TortoiseSVN source tree</a>.
                        This file is used in TortoiseSVN and its resource files. The SubWCRev.exe tool
                        is called from the build script like this:
                        <code>SubWCRev.exe path\\to\\working\\copy version.in version.h</code>
                        This creates a new file <cite>version.h</cite> with all the strings above
                        replaced with the values of the working copy. The <cite>version.h</cite> file
                        is then used in the project itself and included in the resource files for the
                        version information.</p>

                        <h3>... prevent Subversion from doing automatic merges?</h3>
                        <p>Some people don't like the fact that Subversion merges changes from others
                        with their own local working copy changes automatically on update. Here's how to
                        force those files into a conflicted state so you can merge manually at your
                        convenience.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>In TortoiseSVN->Settings->Subversion configuration file, click on the edit button.</li>
                            <li>Change the [helpers] section by adding
                            diff-cmd = "C:\\false.bat"
                            diff3-cmd = "C:\\false.bat"
                            (note the double backslash)</li>
                            <li>Create the file C:\false.bat which contains two lines
                            <pre>
@type %9
@exit 1</pre>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This effectively makes auto-merge fail every time, forcing the file into conflict.</p>
                        <p>The reason for the curious 'type %9' line is that the diff3-cmd sends the
                        merged output to stdout. Subversion then takes this and overwrites your local
                        file with the merge results. Adding this line avoids getting an empty local file.</p>

                        explorer context menu. Then, in the properties dialog, switch to the "Subversion"
                        tab. There you can see all sorts of information about the selected folder,
                        including to what URL it points to.</p>
                        <p>Another quick way of seeing this information is to select "Relocate" from the
                        context menu and look at the first URL. Since you don't want to relocate your WC,
                        just abort this dialog.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>There are actually 2 different files in the repository whose names differ
                            only in case. This <em>cannot</em> work on a Windows checkout,
                            because the Windows file system is not case-sensitive. It is likely that one of
                            the files got added by mistake, so you need to find out which one, make sure
                            there are no changes committed to the wrong file, then delete it.</li>
                            <li>There is a file with an illegal (illegal on Windows) filename. For example
                            names like "con", "lpr", "com", etc. are illegal on Windows because those are
                            device names. And of course names with "/\*?:|" and some other special chars
                            in them are also not possible on Windows (NTFS and FAT).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>And yes, we know the error message isn't really helpful in this case. But the
                        error message comes from the Subversion library, which we can't change on our own.</p>
                        <p>There are several ways to solve the problem and to prevent it from happening

                        and seems to be common on Windows 7 systems.
                        It is due to another process holding a handle on a file that Subversion needs
                        to move or modify. This might be a virus scanner. Configure the virus scanner
                        so that your working copies and repositories are excluded from being scanned.</p>
                        <p>
                        Note: there's a bug in Win7 which causes this error message to appear a lot more

                        <p>This error message typically occurs when you try to update your working copy.
                        It is thrown because Subversion never deletes or overwrites existing local data.
                        There may be three reasons why you get this error:</p>
                        <ol>
                        <li>You have a local unversioned file with the same name as a file which has
                        been added by somebody else recently. In this case the solution is to move your
                        local file somewhere else (or rename it), then update. Afterwards you can decide
                        whether the two files need to be combined in some way, or if the choice of name
                        is purely coincidental you can give your file a different name.</li>
                        <li>A file has been renamed in the repository, but it differs only in case,
                        like <cite>Install.txt</cite> to <cite>install.txt</cite>, and you have local
                        changes. When you update, you end up in a situation (1), where the modified
                        local file appears as unversioned. Move it somewhere else, update, then sort
                        out the mess.</li>
                        <li>There are actually 2 different files in the repository whose names differ
                        only in case. This <em>cannot</em> work on a Windows checkout,
                        because the Windows file system is not case-sensitive. It is likely that one of
                        the files got added by mistake, so you need to find out which one, make sure
                        there are no changes committed to the wrong file, then delete it.</li>

                        <h3>OPTIONS of '&lt;path&gt;': 401 Authorization Required &lt;url&gt;</h3>
                        <p>When upgrading to version 1.4.x, you suddenly can't access your repository
                        anymore. Every try is rejected with the error message: <em>OPTIONS of 'path': 401 Authorization Required 'url'</em></p>
                        <p>The reason for this is the automatic authentication with SSPI which is
                        activated in version 1.4.x. That means TortoiseSVN now tries to authenticate
                        automatically with the credentials of the user logged on to the Windows domain
                        controller.</p>
                        <p>If you have set up your server to authenticate with SSPI against a domain
                        controller, and the domain controller does not have the user account GUEST
                        enabled, you should be fine. But if the user account GUEST is active, then all
                        authentication succeeds with that user - and you usually won't give the user
                        GUEST access to your repository. That's why the <em>authentication</em> succeeds,
                        but the <em>authorization</em> fails.</p>
                        <p>Another reason why it can fail is if you have set up different accounts
                        for the repository access than you use for logging in to your workstations
                        (although then I wonder why you are using SSPI authentication in the first place).</p>
                        <p>To solve this issue you have the following options:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>disable the GUEST account on the domain controller</li>
                            <li>use the same accounts for your workstations and access to the repository</li>
                            <li>disable SSPI authentication for the repository</li>
                            <li>Check the case of the usernames. Changing the usernames in the access files to lowercase also might solve this problem</li>

                        <p>You will get this error message once you have used a Subversion client linked
                        with a higher Subversion version, and then try to execute a command with a
                        Subversion client linked with an older version, e.g., you used an 1.4.x client
                        on your working copy, and now you try an svn 1.3.x client on the same working copy.</p>
                        <p>The reason for this is that Subversion 1.4 and later upgrade the working copies
                        transparently on every command. But once the working copy format is upgraded,
                        older clients can't access the working copy anymore because they don't know the new format.</p>
                        <p>The only solution to 'fix' this is to upgrade whatever client you use and
                        that gave you this error message. Or do a fresh checkout with the older client.</p>

                        <p>You will get this error message when you are trying to commit changes you
                        made to your working copy. Normally this happens, because somebody else has
                        changed the same file(s) in the repository as you have.</p>
                        <p>That means you need to use the <cite>Update</cite> command to update your
                        working copy to the same level as the repository.</p>
                        <p>It may not be obvious why you need to do this, especially if you <em>know</em>
                        the repository has not changed. The answer is simply that your working copy is
                        not completely updated by a commit. Only changed files and folders get updated
                        automatically. Consider this example on a newly created repository:</p>
                        <pre>
Add Folder in revision 1
Add File1 and File2 in revision 2
Modify File1 and commit in revision 3</pre>
                        <p>Now the repository is at revision 3, but in your working copy the revisions look like this:</p>
                        <pre>
Folder     : revision 1
Folder/File1 : revision 3
Folder/File2 : revision 2</pre>
                        <p>Now if you modify File2 and try to commit, it fails. The client tells the
                        repository that File2 is at revision 2 with local modifications, but the repository
                        is already at revision 3. If you then do an update, File2 will be at revision 3
                        as well (and of course your local changes will still be there).</p>
                        <p>The same thing may happen if you try to create a branch or tag. The answer
                        is always the same: If your working copy is out-of-date, update it!</p>

                        <p>TortoisePlink uses the standard plink code, but is compiled as a Windowless
                        app, so there's nowhere to send the error messages to. In TSVN settings->network,
                        set the SSH client box to use standard plink, where the error messages are
                        displayed in a command box. Once that is working, use TortoisePlink with the
                        same parameters.</p>
                        <p>"could not write to standard output" means that Plink wanted to throw an error,
                        but since TortoisePlink doesn't provide a DOS-box there's no standard output to
                        write the error message to.</p>
                        <p>So something with the setup is wrong. Try with the normal plink program and
                        see there what error message really is thrown and then fix the setup.</p>
                        <p>If normal plink just hangs, then the wrong params are passed to it
                        (settings dialog, network tab).</p>
                        <p>Another possibility is that the SSH daemon is most likely not able to find the

                        type &quot;which svnserve&quot;. If you don't see the path to the binary, make
                        this file (and most likely the other subversion binaries) globally accessible
                        to this user.</p>

                        <p>REPORT request failed on '...' REPORT of '...': 400 Bad Request (http://...)</p>
                        <p>You're behind a firewall which blocks DAV requests. Most firewalls do that.
                        Either ask your Administrator to change the firewall, or access the repository
                        with <strong>https://</strong> instead of <strong>http://</strong>.
                        That way you connect to the repository with SSL encryption, which firewalls
                        can't interfere with (if they don't block the SSL port completely).
                        </p>
                        <p>Also some virus scanners (i.e. Kaspersky) are known to interfere and cause
                        this error.</p>

                        <p>It's probably because you've entered the parent path of your repository
                        instead of the actual repository path.  Try appending the name of the repository
                        you wish to access to the URL.  You also need to append the URL with a
                        trailing '/' slash, after the repository name.</p>

                        <p>This message comes in different flavours. You might be seeing this error when:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>PROPFIND Request Failed</strong>
                            You tried to browse the parent path of a repository instead of the repository itself using an older version of TortoiseSVN.  Try appending the name of the repository you wish to access, or upgrade TortoiseSVN to 1.2.3 or newer.</li>
                            <li><strong>PROPFIND Request Failed</strong>
                            You forgot to append a '/' slash to the end of the URL you entered.  Older versions of TSVN require that there be a '/' after the repository name.  If you forget this, TSVN will strip the repository name from the URL and therefore try to access the parent directory.</li>
                            <li><strong>PROPFIND Request Failed</strong>
                            You try to access the repository through a proxy which does not allow DAV requests. Usually you can browse your repository with your webbrowser just fine, only if you use a svn client you get this error. You have to configure your proxy/firewall server to let DAV requests through. Or try using https instead of http: most proxies can't analyze encrypted network packets and therefore can't block DAV requests anymore.
                            <br/>
                            Another possibility for this error is a virus scanner/firewall you have running on your machine. A lot of those filter out DAV requests without you even noticing it. Try disabling the scanner/firewalll.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lock Request Failed</strong>
                            You tried to lock a file in your working copy which no longer exists in the repository. Update your working copy before trying to lock files.</li>
                        </ul>
