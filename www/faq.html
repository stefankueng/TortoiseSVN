<h2><a name="whatistortoiseSVN">What is TortoiseSVN?</a></h2>
<p>TortoiseSVN lets you work with files under <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> version control directly from
Windows Explorer.  It is freely available under the <a href=http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php>GPL</a> open source
license.  For more general information and screen shots, go to <a href="http://www.tortoisesvn.org">www.tortoisesvn.org</a>.

<h2><a name="whydonticonsappear">Why don't the icon overlays appear?</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>If you are using Windows 95 the icon overlays won't appear.  You can try the instructions
for Windows NT4 below if you like, but it may still not work.
<li>If you are using Windows NT4, you need to
install the IE4 shell or desktop extensions to get a more recent version
of Explorer.

To do this install IE4, and choose Yes to install the active desktop.
Don't worry, you can turn off the actual active desktop later by right
clicking on it.  It's the new version of Explorer that we are after.

<p>If you've already installed IE5, you must either: <ol> <li>Uninstall
IE5 and then install IE4 with desktop extensions, and then install IE5
again. What a palaver.  <li>Run IE5 setup with command line switches to
install the IE4 desktop (shell) extensions.  This may cause problems, <a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&safe=off&th=a141d6286e4b302a,4&seekm=OlDwT17y%24GA.280%40cppssbbsa04#p">read
this usenet thread</a> for the source of this information.  <p>The
command must be run from the folder that contains the ie5setup.exe file.
If the browser appears unstable afterwards just run the IE5 repair function.

<p>For Win95: ie5setup.exe /c:"ie5wzd /e:IE4Shell WIN /I:Y"

<p>For WinNT: ie5setup.exe /c:"ie5wzd /e:IE4Shell NTx86 /I:Y" </ol>

<p>For IE6: <ol> <li>Run IE6 setup with command line switches to install
the IE4 desktop (shell) extensions. The same caveats apply as for IE5.
<p>The command must be run from the folder that contains the
ie6setup.exe file.

<p>For WinNT: ie6setup.exe /c:"ie6wzd /e:IE4Shell NTx86 /I:Y" </ol>

<p>The shortcut labelled Win NT Explorer on your start
menu probably points to <tt>C:\WINNT\explorer.scf</tt> and
<b>doesn't</b> get the overlays.  <p>Create a new shortcut to
<br><tt>%windir%\Explorer.exe /n, /e</tt> <br>and it may get the overlays.

<li>If you're using an IntelliPoint mouse driver, and launching Explorer
via a mouse click, you need to upgrade from version 3 to version 3.2 of
IntelliPoint.  Strangely, launching Explorer from the Start menu gives
icons in this case, but not when launched from the mouse.

</ul>

<h2><a name="whyisiconcachebuggy">Why do the overlay icons sometimes
change to random graphics?</a></h2> The Windows icon cache is a fairly
buggy creature.   You can solve this in one of the following ways:

<ul> <li>Install Microsoft's <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/downloads/powertoys/networking/nttweakui.asp">TweakUI</a>
and run the option to rebuild icons.  <li>Or increase the icon cache size. Go to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer and
add a new String Value called "Max Cached Icons". The default value is 500 -
try increasing it to 2048 (see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q132/6/68.asp">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q132/6/68.asp</a> for more details).  <li>Or delete the file called ShellIconCache
in your Windows directory.  And reboot.

</ul>

<h2><a name="howchangedefaulticons">Those icons are grotesque, I
want better ones!</a></h2>
You can create your own icon set if you want. And if you do please
contribute them to the rest of the world!
<p>The icons should have at least two sizes (16x16 and 32x32 with 16 colors), for
Windows XP there should also be a set with 48x48 pixels</p>
<p>to install the icons you should copy them to the directory where
TortoiseSVN was installed. There you can either replace the existing icons or give them
new names. If you choose not to overwrite the original ones then you also need to tweak
some registry settings. Under HKLM\Software\TortoiseSVN\ change the keys ConflictIcon, InSubversionIcon and ModifiedIcon
to the path and names of your own icon set.</p>
<p>after that you need to restart (or logoff) your computer so that explorer reads
in the icons again. Alternatively you can flush the icon cache with the
<a href=http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/downloads/powertoys/networking/nttweakui.asp>TweakUI</a>
tool from Microsoft. For WinXP you can get it <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp>here</a></p>

<h2><a name="uninstallation">How do I uninstall TortoiseSVN?</a></h2>
<p>Simply uninstall from Add/Remove Programs in the Windows
control panel.</p>

<h2><a name="ooopsundeletion">I accidentally removed a file, and
now it's gone!</a></h2>
You can do a <em>revert</em> on the parent folder where you deleted
the file. But use that carefully: you will loose all changes you
made in that folder since you last committed!

<h2><a name="commitremove">When I remove a file it vanishes, how do I
commit it?</a></h2> Easy, you commit the whole directory!  Right click
in the Explorer window next to the file, and choose commit.  I nearly
always commit things from the top level directory - it is recursive
through the whole project.

<h2><a name="showlog">Where's the "Show Log" command?</a></h2>
It's available at two locations:
<ul>
  <li>after an update there's a button to show the log for all the revisions you just updated to</li>
  <li>select a file, right-click to get the context menu, click on "properties" to get the explorer
      properties dialog. Select the TortoiseSVN tab and then theres the button to show the log.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="mixandmatch">Can I mix and match with the Subversion command line
client?</a></h2> Yes, you can change from one client to another whenever you
want.

<h2><a name="lotsofwc">Can I work on lots of working copies from different
repositories at once?</a></h2> Yes, you can.  This is a standard feature
of SVN.  Each directory which was checked out of SVN remembers where it
came from. You can even multiply select working copies which came from
different places, and update or commit them all at once.
<p>If you want to have different subdirectories to come from different repositories
you can set a special Subversion property called <em>svn:externals</em>. Please
look at the chapter <a href=http://svnbook.red-bean.com/html-chunk/ch06s03.html>External Definitions</a>
in the <a href=http://svnbook.red-bean.com>Subversion Book</a>.

<h2><a name="conflicts">How does TortoiseSVN handle conflicts?</a></h2>
Imagine you check out revision 24 of a file and started editing it. In the
meantime, someone else committed revision 25, and shortly after that
revision 26. You tell TortoiseSVN to update your file now, and SVN will try
to incorporate all the changes between revision 24 and 26 into your local
file.
<p>
But if the changes made between 24 and 26 were too close to or even
overlap with the changes you have made, SVN detects a conflict and creates
<em>conflict markers</em> in the file. Subversion also creates three
special files for every conflicted file:
<ol>
<li><em>filename.*.mine</em> This is your file as it existed in your working copy
before you updated your working copy—that is, without conflict markers.
This file has your latest changes in it and nothing else.
<li><em>filename.*.rOLDREV</em> This is the file that was the BASE revision
before you updated your working copy. That is, the file that you checked
out before you made your latest edits.
<li><em>filename.*.rNEWREV</em>This is the file that your Subversion client
just received from the server when you updated your working copy. This file
corresponds to the HEAD revision of the repository.
</ol>
At this point TortoiseSVN will not allow you to committ the conflicted file
until you <em>resolved</em> the conflict. To tell TortoiseSVN that you
resolved the conflict simply delete the three additional files or use
the command <em>resolve</em> to do that for you.

<p>Thank you for offering!</p>
<p>We set up wish lists for both of us. The media wish list of Stefan is <a href=http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/17DKTOSXX1KJK>here</a>
and the wish list of Tim can be found <a href=http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/wishlist/2U803HOYD098W>here</a>.</p>
