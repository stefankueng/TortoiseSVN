<h3>Spell checker</h3>
<p>
If a spell checker dictionary is installed, TortoiseSVN will use it
to check your log messages while you type:
</p>

<p>
You can download the spell checker for different languages <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=138498&package_id=166583">here</a>.

<h3>Auto completion</h3>
<p>
While you are typing your log message for the commit, TortoiseSVN shows you choices
for keywords or paths you might want to enter:
</p>
<img alt="Commit dialog, autocompletion" src="images/CommitDlgAutoCompletion.png">
<p>
The paths are taken from the list of modified files. The keywords are extracted
from the same files.

<h3>Message formatting</h3>
<p>
Log messages in Subversion are pure, simple text. But sometimes you want
to emphasize some words in your log messages. This is where the text formatting
feature of TortoiseSVN helps out:
</p>

<p>
Text in between '*' chars is made bold, in between '_' chars underlined and in between '^' chars made italic.
Of course, the same formatting happens later in the log dialog.
