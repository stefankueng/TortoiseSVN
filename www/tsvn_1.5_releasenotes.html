<h2>What's New in TortoiseSVN 1.5</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Merge Tracking</li>
  <li>Sparse checkouts</li>
  <li>Cyrus SASL support for ra_svn and <tt>svnserve</tt></li>
  <li>Changelist support</li>
  <li>Log message caching</li>
  <li>Repository browser</li>
  <li>Revision graph</li>
</ul>

<p>Details are described below.</p>

<p>TortoiseSVN 1.5 is a superset of all previous TortoiseSVN releases,
and is considered the current stable and "best" release.  Anything in 1.0.x,
1.1.x, 1.2.x or 1.3.x is also in 1.5, but 1.5 contains features and
bugfixes not present in any earlier release.</p>

</div>  <!-- news -->

<div class="h2" id="compatibility" title="compatibility">
<h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.5
servers and clients.  Of course, some of the new 1.5 features may not
be available unless both client and server are the latest version
(e.g. <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/merge-tracking/func-spec.html#migration-and-interoperability"
>Merge Tracking</a>).</p>

</div>  <!-- compatibility -->

<div class="h2" id="merge-tracking" title="merge-tracking">
<h2>Merge Tracking</h2>

<p>Merge Tracking in Subversion 1.5.0 is roughly equivalent in
functionality to <a
href="http://www.orcaware.com/svn/wiki/Svnmerge.py">svnmerge.py</a>,
recording and using merge history to avoid common cases of the
repeated merge problem, and allowing for cherry-picking of changes.
It exposes merge history via properties, and allows for repository
dump/load (including the ability to re-create the merge history
index).</p>

<p>Some merge tracking features can't be used for repositories served
by pre-1.5.x servers.</p>

<div class="h3" id="repeated-merge">
<h3>Repeated Merge</h3>

<p>When working on a branch, Subversion now tracks each revision which
gets merged. This makes it easier to merge changes e.g., from trunk
because it is possible to always merge the whole revision range without
the risk of merging the same revision twice. Subversion will automatically
omit the already merged revisions when doing the merge.</p>

<img src="/images/LogWithGrayedMerge.png" alt="Log dialog showing already 
merged entries grayed out" />

<p>When showing the log from the merge dialog to find the revisions to
merge, TortoiseSVN shows the already merged revisions grayed out as
a visual hint. If a grayed out revision is selected, Subversion does
not merge that revision again because it was already merged.</p>

</div>  <!-- repeated-merge -->

<div class="h3" id="manual-merge">
<h3>Record Manual Merge</h3>

<p>To block a revision from being merged, TortoiseSVN provides a button
in the merge dialog named "record only". This will tell Subversion that
the revision has already been merged, without doing the merge itself.</p>

</div>  <!-- manual-merge -->

<div class="h3" id="merge-info">
<h3>Merge Information</h3>

<p>When inspecting revisions with the log dialog, the messages of revisions
where a merge occurred aren't usually very useful. Most people write
log messages in the form "merged revisions XXX to YYY from /branches/ZZZ"
or something similar. But what's really interesting when examining the
log of a folder/file would be the log messages of all the revisions
that got merged.</p>

<img src="/images/LogWithoutMerge.png" alt="Log dialog showing entries 
without merge history" />

<p>TortoiseSVN can show you those log messages if you want. The log dialog
has a checkbox which when activated will fetch all the log messages of
merged revisions. The log entries of merged revisions are shown a little
intended.</p>

with merge history" />

<div class="h2" id="sparse-checkouts" title="sparse-checkouts">
<h2>Sparse checkouts</h2>

<p>Many users have very large trees of which they only want to checkout 
certain parts. In case of folders with many subfolders, some of the
subfolders might not be needed.</p>
<p>TortoiseSVN provides the user with a combo box to choose the depth
of a checkout:
<ul>
<li>Fully recursive</li>
<li>Immediate children, including folders</li>
<li>Only file children</li>
<li>Only this item</li>
</ul>
The depth of the checkout is remembered, so that a later <em>update</em>
will respect that depth and not fetch everything again.</p>

</div> <!-- sparse-checkouts -->


<div class="h2" id="cyrus-sasl" title="cyrus-sasl">
<h2>Cyrus SASL support for <tt>svnserve</tt></h2>

<p>In Subversion 1.5, svnserve can use SASL for authentication. 
TortoiseSVN has SASL implemented too. The following SASL authentication
methods are available with TortoiseSVN 1.5:
<ul>
<li>ANONYMOUS</li>
<li>CRAM-MD5</li>
<li>PLAIN</li>
<li>DIGEST-MD5</li>
<li>LOGIN</li>
<li>NTLM</li>
</ul>
</p>

</div> <!-- cyrus-sasl -->


<div class="h2" id="changelist-support" title="changelist-support">
<h2>Changelist support</h2>

<p>Sometimes you are working on several different problems at once
in your working copy, and it becomes difficult to track which files are
involved in which change. TortoiseSVN now allows you to group files together
into logical <em>changesets</em>. These appear in the Commit dialog and the
Check for Modifications dialog. As well as giving a visual indication, you
can also select groups for commit.
</p>
<img src="/images/ChangeList.png" alt="Commit dialog showing changelists
grouped together" />

</div>  <!-- changelist-support -->


<div class="h2" id="log-cache" title="Log Cache">
<h2>Log Cache</h2>

<p>Fetching the log information from the repository can take a long
time, especially for repositories with thousands of revisions.</p>

<p>TortoiseSVN 1.5 can cache the log entries on the local drive. Only
the entries which are not yet in the local cache are fetched from the
repository.</p>

</div>  <!-- log-cache -->


<div class="h2" id="repository-browser" title="repository-browser">
<h2>Repository browser</h2>

<p>The repository browser has been completely rewritten and now
resembles more the Windows explorer. It has two panes, with a tree
view on the left and the file/folder list on the right.</p>

<img src="/images/RepositoryBrowser.png" alt="Repository Browser" />

<p>Part of the rewrite also included a performance improvement when
showing very big directories.</p>

</div>  <!-- repository-browser -->


<div class="h2" id="revision-graph" title="revision-graph">
<h2>Revision Graph</h2>

<p>The revision graph has changed dramatically since the last release.
Apart from using the log cache if available, it is also much faster when
analyzing the log data.</p>

<p>A small window on the top right of the graph shows an overview of the
whole graph.</p>

<p>The new revision graph has much more options to tweak the output.
For example, the direction of the graph, how the nodes are arranged in
the graph or which nodes/paths/urls should be filtered out completely.</p>
