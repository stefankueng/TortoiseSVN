<h2>What's New in TortoiseSVN 1.5</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Merge Tracking</li>
  <li>Sparse checkouts</li>
  <li>Cyrus SASL support for ra_svn and <tt>svnserve</tt></li>
  <li>Changelist support</li>
  <li>Repository browser</li>
  <li>Revision graph</li>
  <li>Log message caching</li>
</ul>

<p>Details are described below.</p>

<p>TortoiseSVN 1.5 is a superset of all previous TortoiseSVN releases,
and is considered the current stable and "best" release.  Anything in 1.0.x,
1.1.x, 1.2.x or 1.3.x is also in 1.5, but 1.5 contains features and
bugfixes not present in any earlier release.</p>

</div>  <!-- news -->

<div class="h2" id="compatibility" title="compatibility">
<h2>Compatibility Concerns</h2>

<p>Older clients and servers interoperate transparently with 1.5
servers and clients.  Of course, some of the new 1.5 features may not
be available unless both client and server are the latest version
(e.g. <a href="/merge-tracking/func-spec.html#migration-and-interoperability"
>Merge Tracking</a>).</p>

</div>  <!-- compatibility -->

<div class="h2" id="merge-tracking" title="merge-tracking">
<h2>Merge Tracking</h2>

<p>Merge Tracking in Subversion 1.5.0 is roughly equivalent in
functionality to <a
href="http://www.orcaware.com/svn/wiki/Svnmerge.py">svnmerge.py</a>,
recording and using merge history to avoid common cases of the
repeated merge problem, and allowing for cherry-picking of changes.
It exposes merge history via properties, and allows for repository
dump/load (including the ability to re-create the merge history
index).  It adds <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">sqlite</a> as a
dependency, and supports both the FSFS and BerkeleyDB Subversion file
system backends.</p>

<p>Some merge tracking features can't be used for repositories served
by pre-1.5.x servers</p>

<div class="h3" id="repeated-merge">
<h3>Repeated Merge</h3>

<p>When working on a branch, Subversion now tracks each revision which
gets merged. This makes it easier to merge changes e.g., from trunk
because it is possible to always merge the whole revision range without
the risk of merging the same revision twice. Subversion will automatically
ommit the already merged revisions when doing the merge.</p>

<p>When showing the log from the merge dialog to find the revisions to
merge, TortoiseSVN shows the already merged revisions grayed out as
a visual hint. If a grayed out revision is selected, Subversion does
not merge that revision again because it was already merged.</p>

</div>  <!-- repeated-merge -->

<div class="h3" id="manual-merge">
<h3>Record Manual Merge</h3>

<p>To block a revision from being merged, TortoiseSVN provides a button
in the merge dialog named "record only". This will tell Subversion that
the revision has already been merged, without doing the merge itself.</p>

</div>  <!-- manual-merge -->

</div> <!-- merge-tracking -->



<div class="h2" id="sparse-checkouts" title="sparse-checkouts">
<h2>Sparse checkouts</h2>

<p>Many users have very large trees of which they only want to checkout 
certain parts. In case of folders with many subfolders, some of the
subfolders might not be needed.</p>
<p>TortoiseSVN provides the user with a combo box to choose the depth
of a checkout:
<ul>
<li>Fully recursive</li>
<li>Immediate children, including folders</li>
<li>Only file children</li>
<li>Only this item</li>
</ul>
The depth of the checkout is remembered, so that a later <em>update</em>
will respect that depth and not fetch everything again.</p>

</div> <!-- sparse-checkouts -->

<div class="h2" id="cyrus-sasl" title="cyrus-sasl">
<h2>Cyrus SASL support for <tt>svnserve</tt></h2>

<p>In Subversion 1.5, svnserve can use SASL for authentication. 
TortoiseSVN has SASL implemented too. The following SASL authentication
methods are available with TortoiseSVN 1.5.x:
<ul>
<li>ANONYMOUS</li>
<li>CRAM-MD5</li>
<li>PLAIN</li>
<li>DIGEST-MD5</li>
<li>LOGIN</li>
<li>NTLM</li>
</ul>
</p>

</div> <!-- cyrus-sasl -->

<div class="h2" id="changelist-support" title="changelist-support">
<h2>Changelist support</h2>

<p>XXX: Described <a
href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/notes/changelist-design.txt"
>here</a>.</p>

<div class="h2" id="enhancements" title="enhancements">
<h2>Enhancements and Bugfixes</h2>

<div class="h3" id="repository-browser" title="repository-browser">
<h3>Repository browser</h3>

<p>The repository browser has been completely rewritten and now
resembles more the Windows explorer. It has two panes, with a tree
view on the left and the file/folder list on the right.</p>
<p>Part of the rewrite also included a performance improvement when
showing very big directories.</p>
