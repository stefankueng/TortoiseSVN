this page is a slightly modified version of the page <a href=http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html>"How to ask questions the smart way"</a>,
adapted for the TortoiseSVN project mailing list.
<ul>
<font size=-1 color="#003399" face="verdana, Arial, sans-serif" onClick="expandIt(p1); return false" CLASS="outline"><b>Introduction</b></font> 
<DIV ID="p1" CLASS="hiddentext">
<ul><p>In the world of Open-Source developers, the kind of answers you get to your questions 
depends as much on the way you ask the questions as on the difficulty of developing the answer. 
This guide will teach you how to ask questions in a way that is likely to get you a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>Despite this, we have a reputation for meeting simple questions with what looks like hostility or arrogance. 
It sometimes looks like we're reflexively rude to newbies and the ignorant. But this isn't really true.</p>

<p>What we are, unapologetically, is hostile to people who seem to be unwilling to think or to do their own 
homework before asking questions. People like that are time sinks — they take without giving back, 
they waste time we could have spent on another question more interesting and another person more 
worthy of an answer. We call people like this "losers" (and for historical reasons we sometimes spell it "lusers").</p>

<p>We realize that there are many people who just want to use the software we write, and have no interest 
in learning technical details. For most people, a computer is merely a tool, a means to an end; they have 
more important things to do and lives to live. We acknowledge that, and don't expect everyone to take an 
interest in the technical matters that fascinate us. Nevertheless, our style of answering questions is tuned 
for people who do take such an interest and are willing to be active participants in problem-solving. 
That's not going to change. Nor should it; if it did, we would become less effective at the things we do best.</p>

<p>We're volunteers. We take time out of busy lives to answer questions, and at times we're overwhelmed with them. 
So we filter ruthlessly. In particular, we throw away questions from people who appear to be losers in order to 
spend our question-answering time more efficiently, on winners.</p>

<p>If you find this attitude obnoxious, condescending, or arrogant, check your assumptions. We're not asking you 
to genuflect to us — in fact, most of us would love nothing more than to deal with you as an equal and welcome 
you into our culture, if you put in the effort required to make that possible. But it's simply not efficient 
for us to try to help people who are not willing to help themselves. It's OK to be ignorant; it's not OK to play stupid.</p>

<p>So, while it isn't necessary to already be technically competent to get attention from us, it is necessary to 
demonstrate the kind of attitude that leads to competence — alert, thoughtful, observant, willing to be an active 
partner in developing a solution. If you can't live with this sort of discrimination, we suggest you pay somebody 
for a commercial support contract instead of asking developers to personally donate help to you.</p>

<p>If you decide to come to us for help, you don't want to be one of the losers. You don't want to seem like one, either. 
The best way to get a rapid and responsive answer is to ask it like a person with smarts, confidence, and clues who just 
happens to need help on one particular problem.</p>

</ul>
</DIV><br><br>

<font size=-1 color="#003399" face="verdana, Arial, sans-serif" onClick="expandIt(p2); return false" CLASS="outline"><b>Before you ask, try finding the answer yourself</b></font> 
<DIV ID="p2" CLASS="hiddentext">
<ul>

<p>Before asking a question do the following:</p>

<li>Try to find an answer by searching the Web.

<li>Try to find an answer by reading the manual.

<li>Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.

<li>Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.

<li>Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.

<li>If you are a developer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.

<p>When you ask your question, display the fact that you have done these things first; this will help establish that 
you're not being a lazy sponge and wasting people's time. Better yet, display what you have learned from doing these 
things. We like answering questions for people who have demonstrated that they can learn from the answers.</p>

<p>Use tactics like doing a Google search on the text of whatever error message you get (and search Google groups 
as well as web pages). This might well take you straight to fix documentation or a mailing list thread that will 
answer your question. Even if it doesn't, saying "I googled on the following phrase but didn't get anything that looked 
useful" is a good thing to be able to put in email or news posting requesting help.</p>

<p>Prepare your question. Think it through. Hasty-sounding questions get hasty answers, or none at all. The more you 
do to demonstrate that you have put thought and effort into solving your problem before asking for help, 
the more likely you are to actually get help.</p>

<p>Beware of asking the wrong question. If you ask one that is based on faulty assumptions, we are quite likely to reply with 
a uselessly literal answer while thinking "Stupid question...", and hoping that the experience of getting what you asked 
for rather than what you needed will teach you a lesson.</p>

<p>Never assume you are entitled to an answer. You are not; you aren't, after all, paying for the service. You will earn 
an answer, if you earn it, by asking a question that is substantial, interesting, and thought-provoking — one that implicitly 
contributes to the experience of the community rather than merely passively demanding knowledge from others.</p>

<p>On the other hand, making it clear that you are able and willing to help in the process of developing the solution 
is a very good start. "Would someone provide a pointer?", "What is my example missing?" and "What site should I have checked?" 
are more likely to get answered than "Please post the exact procedure I should use." because you're making it clear that you're 
truly willing to complete the process if someone can simply point you in the right direction.</p>

</ul>
</DIV><br><br>

<font size=-1 color="#003399" face="verdana, Arial, sans-serif" onClick="expandIt(p3); return false" CLASS="outline"><b>use the mailing list</b></font> 
<DIV ID="p3" CLASS="hiddentext">
<ul>

<p>Write to the mailing list, not to individual developers, even if you believe that you know who can answer your question best. 
Check the documentation of the project and its homepage for the address of a project mailing list, and use it. 
There are several good reasons for this policy:</p>

<li>Any question that's good enough to be asked of one developer will also be of value to the whole group. 
Contrariwise, if you suspect that your question is too dumb for a mailing list, it's not an excuse to harass individual developers.

<li>Asking questions on the list distributes load between developers. The individual developer (especially if he's the project leader) 
may be too busy to answer your questions.

<li>Most mailing lists are archived and the archives are indexed by search engines. Somebody could find your question and the answer 
on the web instead of asking it again in the list.

<li>If certain questions are seen to be asked often, the developers can use that information to improve the documentation or the 
software itself to be less confusing. But if those questions are asked in private, nobody has the complete picture 
of what questions are asked most often.

</ul>
</DIV><br><br>

<font size=-1 color="#003399" face="verdana, Arial, sans-serif" onClick="expandIt(p4); return false" CLASS="outline"><b>Write in clear, grammatical, correctly-spelled language</b></font> 
<DIV ID="p4" CLASS="hiddentext">
<ul>

<p>We've found by experience that people who are careless and sloppy writers are usually also careless and sloppy at thinking 
and coding (often enough to bet on, anyway). Answering questions for careless and sloppy thinkers is not rewarding; we'd rather spend our time elsewhere.</p>

<p>So expressing your question clearly and well is important. If you can't be bothered to do that, we can't be bothered to pay attention. 
Spend the extra effort to polish your language. It doesn't have to be stiff or formal — in fact, developer culture values informal, 
slangy and humorous language used with precision. But it has to be precise; there has to be some indication that you're thinking and paying attention.</p>

<p>Spell, punctuate, and capitalize correctly. Don't confuse "its" with "it's", "loose" with "lose", or "discrete" with "discreet". 
Don't TYPE IN ALL CAPS, this is read as shouting and considered rude. (All-smalls is only slightly less annoying, as it's difficult 
to read.)</p>

<p>More generally, if you write like a semi-literate boob you will very likely be ignored. Writing like a l33t script kiddie hax0r 
is the absolute kiss of death and guarantees you will receive nothing but stony silence (or, at best, a heaping helping of scorn and sarcasm) in return.</p>

<p>If you are asking questions in a forum that does not use your native language, you will get a limited amount of slack for spelling 
and grammar errors — but no extra slack at all for laziness (and yes, we can usually spot that difference). Also, unless you know what 
your respondent's languages are, write in English. Busy developers tend to simply flush questions in languages they don't understand, and 
English is the working language of the Internet. By writing in English you minimize your chances that your question will be discarded unread.</p>


</ul>
</DIV><br><br>

<font size=-1 color="#003399" face="verdana, Arial, sans-serif" onClick="expandIt(p5); return false" CLASS="outline"><b>Use meaningful, specific subject headers</b></font> 
<DIV ID="p5" CLASS="hiddentext">
<ul>

<p>On mailing lists or newsgroups, the subject header is your golden opportunity to attract qualified experts' 
attention in around 50 characters or fewer. Don't waste it on babble like "Please help me" (let alone "PLEASE HELP ME!!!!"; 
messages with subjects like that get discarded by reflex). Don't try to impress us with the depth of your anguish; 
use the space for a super-concise problem description instead.</p>

<p>A good convention for subject headers, used by many tech support organizations, is "object - deviation". 
The "object" part specifies what thing or group of things is having a problem, and the "deviation" part describes 
the deviation from expected behavior.</p>

<p>Stupid: <br>
HELP! TSVN doesn't work</p>

<p>Smart:<br>
Commit command not working</p>

<p>Smarter:<br>
Commit command in version 0.xx not working</p>

<p>The process of writing an "object-deviation" description will help you organize your thinking about the problem in more detail. 
What is affected? The shell extension part or the main part? Is it specific to my system? To version 0.xx? </p>

<p>If you ask a question in a reply, be sure to change the subject line to indicate that you are asking a question.
 A Subject line that looks like "Re: test" or "Re: new bug" is less likely to attract useful amounts of attention. 
 Also, pare quotes of previous messages to the minimum consistent with cluing in new readers.</p>

<p>Do not simply hit reply to a list message in order to start an entirely new thread. This will limit your audience. 
Some mail readers, allow the user to sort by thread and then hide messages in a thread by folding the thread. Folks who do that 
will never see your message.</p>

</ul>
</DIV><br><br>

<font size=-1 color="#003399" face="verdana, Arial, sans-serif" onClick="expandIt(p6); return false" CLASS="outline"><b>Be precise and informative about your problem</b></font> 
<DIV ID="p6" CLASS="hiddentext">
<ul>
<li>Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.

<li>Describe the environment in which it occurs (machine, OS, application, whatever).  

<li>Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem before you asked the question. 

<li>Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem yourself before you asked the question. 

<li>Describe any recent changes in your computer or software configuration that might be relevant. 

<p>Do the best you can to anticipate the questions a developer will ask, and to answer them in advance in your request for help.</p>

<p>Simon Tatham has written an excellent essay entitled 
<a href=http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html>How to Report Bugs Effectively</a>. I strongly recommend that you read it.</p>

</ul>
</DIV><br><br>

<font size=-1 color="#003399" face="verdana, Arial, sans-serif" onClick="expandIt(p7); return false" CLASS="outline"><b>Don't claim that you have found a bug</b></font> 
<DIV ID="p7" CLASS="hiddentext">
<ul>
<p>When you are having problems with a piece of software, don't claim you have found a bug unless you are very, very sure of your ground. 
Hint: unless you can provide a source-code patch that fixes the problem, or a regression test against a previous version that demonstrates 
incorrect behavior, you are probably not sure enough.</p>

<p>Remember, there are a lot of other users that are not experiencing your problem. Otherwise you would have learned about it while reading 
the documentation and searching the Web (you did do that before complaining, didn't you?). This means that very probably it is you who are 
doing something wrong, not the software.</p>

<p>The people who wrote the software work very hard to make it work as well as possible. If you claim you have found a bug, you'll be implying 
that they did something wrong, and you will almost always offend them — even when you are correct. It's epecially undiplomatic to yell “bug” 
in the Subject line.</p>

<p>When asking your question, it is best to write as though you assume you are doing something wrong, even if you are privately pretty sure 
you have found an actual bug. If there really is a bug, you will hear about it in the answer. Play it so the maintainers will want to apologize 
to you if the bug is real, rather than so that you will owe them an apology if you have messed up.</p>

<font size=-1 color="#003399" face="verdana, Arial, sans-serif" onClick="expandIt(p8); return false" CLASS="outline"><b>Describe your problems symptoms, not your guesses</b></font> 
<DIV ID="p8" CLASS="hiddentext">
<ul>
<li>It's not useful to tell what you think is causing your problem. (If your diagnostic theories were such hot stuff, would you be consulting 
others for help?) So, make sure you're telling them the raw symptoms of what goes wrong, rather than your interpretations and theories. 
Let them do the interpretation and diagnosis.
<li>Describe the symptoms in chronological order. The most useful clues in figuring out something that went wrong often lie in the events 
immediately prior. So, your account should describe precisely what you did, and what the machine did, leading up to the blowup.
</ul>

<font size=-1 color="#003399" face="verdana, Arial, sans-serif" onClick="expandIt(p9); return false" CLASS="outline"><b>Don't file issues before asking on the mailing list</b></font> 
<DIV ID="p9" CLASS="hiddentext">
<ul>
<p>The issue tracker is used to keep track of unfixed bugs, ideas for enhancements and the like. Not to report what you might think is a bug and not for your personal
wishes to the program.</p>
<p>There are several reasons to ask first on the mailing list instead of directly filing issues:</p>
<li>Most often than not what you think is a bug isn't really a bug
<li>If something really is a bug, developers can discuss and track down a bug much easier on the mailing list than with the issue tracker.
<li>Sometimes a developer already found your bug and is currently working on it. Filing an issue just means more work.
<li>If you want an enhancement/addition to the program discuss it first on the list - other people might have different opinions
on your request, maybe your request would break something else, or someone even has a better idea about what you want to with your wish.
</ul>
</DIV><br><br>

<font size=-1 color="#003399" face="verdana, Arial, sans-serif" onClick="expandIt(p10); return false" CLASS="outline"><b>Don't flag your question as "Urgent", even if it is for you</b></font> 
<DIV ID="p10" CLASS="hiddentext">
<ul>
<p>That's your problem, not ours. Claiming urgency is very likely to be counter-productive: most developers will simply delete such messages as rude 
and selfish attempts to elicit immediate and special attention.</p>
</ul>
</DIV><br><br>

<font size=-1 color="#003399" face="verdana, Arial, sans-serif" onClick="expandIt(p11); return false" CLASS="outline"><b>Follow up with a brief note on the solution</b></font> 
<DIV ID="p11" CLASS="hiddentext">
<ul>

<p>Send a note after the problem has been solved to all who helped you; let them know how it came out and thank them again for their help. 
If the problem attracted general interest in a mailing list or newsgroup, it's appropriate to post the followup there.</p>

<p>Optimally, the reply should be to the thread started by the original question posting, and should have ‘FIXED’ ‘RESOLVED’ or an 
equally obvious tag in the subject line. On mailing lists with fast turnaround, a potential respondent who sees a thread about "Problem X" 
ending with "Problem X - FIXED" knows not to waste his/her time even reading the thread (unless (s)he) personally finds Problem X interesting) 
and can therefore use that time solving a different problem.</p>

<p>Your followup doesn't have to be long and involved; a simple "Howdy — it was a failed network cable! Thanks, everyone. - Bill" would be 
better than nothing. In fact, a short and sweet summary is better than a long dissertation unless the solution has real technical depth. 
Say what action solved the problem, but you need not replay the whole troubleshooting sequence.</p>

<p>For problems with some depth, it is appropriate to post a summary of the troubleshooting history. Describe your final problem statement. 
Describe what worked as a solution, and indicate avoidable blind alleys. Name the names of people who helped you; you'll make friends that way.</p>

<p>Besides being courteous and informative, this sort of followup will help others searching the archive of the mailing-list to know exactly which 
solution helped you and thus may also help them.</p>

<p>Last, and not least, this sort of followup helps everybody who assisted feel a satisfying sense of closure about the problem. 
If you are not a techie or developer yourself, trust us that this feeling is very important to the gurus and experts you tapped for help. 
Problem narratives that trail off into unresolved nothingness are frustrating things; developers itch to see them resolved. The good karma 
that scratching that itch earns you will be very, very helpful to you next time you need to pose a question. </p>

<p>Consider how you might be able to prevent others from having the same problem in the future. Ask yourself if a documentation 
or FAQ patch would help, and if the answer is yes send that patch to the maintainer.</p>

<p>Among developers, this sort of behavior is actually more important than conventional politeness. It's how you get a reputation 
for playing well with others, which can be a very valuable asset.</p>
</ul>
</DIV><br><br>

<font size=-1 color="#003399" face="verdana, Arial, sans-serif" onClick="expandIt(p12); return false" CLASS="outline"><b>Dealing with rudeness</b></font> 
<DIV ID="p12" CLASS="hiddentext">
<ul>

<p>Much of what looks like rudeness in developers circles is not intended to give offence. Rather, it's the product of the direct, 
cut-through-the-bullshit communications style that is natural to people who are more concerned about solving problems 
than making others feel warm and fuzzy.</p>

<p>When you perceive rudeness, try to react calmly. If someone is really acting out, it is very likely that a senior person on the list 
will call him or her on it. If that doesn't happen and you lose your temper, it is likely that the person you lose it at was 
behaving within the developers community's norms and you will be considered at fault. This will hurt your chances of getting 
the information or help you want.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you will occasionally run across rudeness and posturing that is quite gratuitous. The flip-side of the 
above is that it is acceptable form to slam real offenders quite hard, dissecting their misbehavior with a sharp verbal scalpel. 
Be very, very sure of your ground before you try this, however. The line between correcting an incivility and starting a pointless 
flamewar is thin enough that hackers themselves not infrequently blunder across it; if you are a newbie or an outsider, your 
chances of avoiding such a blunder are low. If you're after information rather than entertainment, it's better to keep your 
fingers off the keyboard than to risk this.</p>

<p>(Some people assert that many developers have a mild form of autism or Asperger's Syndrome, and are actually missing 
some of the brain circuitry that lubricates `normal' human social interaction. This may or may not be true. If you are not 
a developer yourself, it may help you cope with our eccentricities if you think of us as being brain-damaged. 
Go right ahead. We won't care; we like being whatever it is we are, and generally have a healthy skepticism about clinical labels.)</p>

<DIV ID="p13" CLASS="hiddentext">
<ul>
<p>Finally, I'm going to illustrate how to ask questions in a smart way by example; pairs of questions about the same 
problem, one asked in a stupid way and one in a smart way.</p>

<p><em>Stupid:</em> Where can I find out stuff about the Commit command? <br>
This question just begs for "RTFM" as a reply.</p>

<p><em>Smart:</em> I used the mailing list search to try to find "Commit command" on the Web, but I got no useful hits. 
Also I couldn't find a solution in the FAQ. Does anyone know where I can find information on this?<br> 
This one has already RTFM, and sounds like he might have a real problem.</p>
<br>
<p><em>Stupid:</em> I can't get the code from project TSVN to compile. Why is it broken? <br>
He assumes that somebody else screwed up. Arrogant of him.</p>

<p><em>Smart:</em> The code from project foo doesn't compile. I've read the FAQ, but it doesn't have anything in it about my problems. 
Here's a transcript of my compilation attempt; is it something I did? <br>
He's specified the environment, he's read the FAQ, he's showing the error, and he's not assuming his problems are someone else's fault. 
This guy might be worth some attention.</p>
<br>

<p><em>Stupid:</em> I'm having problems using the program. Can anybody help? <br>
A developers response to this is likely to be "Right. Do you need burping and diapering, too?" followed by a punch of the delete key.</p>

<p><em>Smart:</em> I tried X, Y, and Z to get the effect P. When that didn't work, I tried A, B, and C. Note the curious symptom when I tried C. 
Anybody got ideas for more tests I can run to pin down the problem?<br>
This person, on the other hand, seems worthy of an answer. He has exhibited problem-solving intelligence rather than 
passively waiting for an answer to drop from on high.</p>
<br>

<p>In the last question, notice the subtle but important difference between demanding "Give me an answer" and "Please help me figure 
out what additional diagnostics I can run to achieve enlightenment."</p>
