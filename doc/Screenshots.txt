<div class="moz-text-flowed" style="font-family: -moz-fixed">This file is a guide to grabbing screenshots for the user manual.
Although there are not many hard and fast rules, some screenshots need
care to set up as they are demonstrating a range of features.

To help with consistency, some of these instructions are presented
as a TortoiseProc.exe command line. These assume that the TSVN
bin directory is in the PATH and that you have a doc folder checked
out at C:\TortoiseSVN\Doc. Adjust the path according to your location.

If you do not already have a screen capture/image viewer program,
download a free copy of IrfanView from www.irfanview.com

General rules for all screenshots
=================================
Use PNG format
8 bit colour depth (256 colours)
Windows XP style preferred

Test Repository
===============
We now have a batch file to create a repository and some working copies
in various states of modification and conflict. In the test folder,
create a file called DocPath.txt which contains the path to your doc
folder, but with forward slashes and URI escaping of spaces and other
funny characters. Now simply run MakeTest.bat to create the test folders
in the 'temp' subfolder.

Instructions for each screenshot
================================
Authenticate.png
	You will have to clear authentication to make this one appear.
	Do this temporarily for the TSVN repo by renaming
	[Application Data]\Subversion\auth\svn.simple\f55fc06b366775f8c026407285be8070

BlameDialog.png
	Blame any file

ch02dia1-7.png
	These are 'borrowed' from the Subversion Book

Changelist.png
	Use the 'doc' test WC.
	Modify 3 files, say dug_add.xml, dug_blame.xml and dug_commit.xml
	Open the commit dialog and add dug_blame.xml to a new changelist 'Blame doc update'.
	Screenshot shows context menu for the changelist.
	Remove dug_blame.xml from the changelist and revert the folder.

Checkout.png
	Just pretend to checkout the TSVN docs:
	TortoiseProc.exe /command:checkout /path:"C:\TortoiseSVN\Doc" /url:"http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/svn/tortoisesvn/trunk/doc"

Commit.png
	Use the 'doc' test WC.
	Modify 3 files, say dug_add.xml, dug_blame.xml and dug_commit.xml
	Modify a server.xml in the 'ext' folder
	Open the commit dialog for the 'doc' folder
	Type a message with spelling problem, eg.
		Update documentation to explain new Frobnicate checkbox.
	Right click on dug_blame and include context menu in screenshot.
	This setup is also used for CommitSpellCheck.png and CreatePatch.png

CommitSpellcheck.png
	As above, but right click on the mis-spelled word to get the context menu.

CommitProgress.png
	Capture the progress dialog at the end of any commit.

ContextMenuDirControl.png
	In explorer, right click on a versioned folder (eg. TSVN docs) and
	capture the main context menu and the large TSVN sub menu.
	You will probably have to capture the entire explorer window and
	then edit out everything except the context menus. Ideally, also edit
	out all non-TSVN items from the main context menu.
	Because of the manual editing, this item (and the next 3) is a bit of
	a pain and generally best left until just before a new release in case
	something else changes.

ContextMenuDirNoControl.png
	As above, but capture for an unversioned folder.

ContextMenuFileControl.png
	As above, but capture for a single versioned file.

ContextMenuFileNoControl.png
	As above, but capture for a single unversioned file.
	Expand the 'add to ignore list' entry.

Copy.png
	Open the branch/tag dialog for the TSVN doc folder and enter a
	fictitious URL for the target. It is easiest to copy and paste the
	source URL and edit /trunk/ to /branches_1.4.x/ or something like that.

CreatePatch.png
	Set up as for the commit dialog, but create a patch instead.
	The dialog shows the files selected for the patch.

ExplorerFileMenu.png
	Use the 'doc' test WC.
	In explorer, right click on showlog.xml and 'Create shortcut'
	Select the newly created shortcut.
	Click on the explorer file menu and capture the menu which opens.
	There should be 3 TSVN entries (shortcut, shortcut-target and folder).
	Delete the shortcut when you're done.

ExportURL.png
	Right click on the TSVN doc folder and Export
	Enter a folder name in the Export directory box

GetLock.png
	Make sure you have the 'Show lock dialog before locking files' option
	checked in Settings->Dialogs 2
	Select a bunch of versioned files and use TSVN->GetLock

Import.png
	Right click on any unversioned folder and TSVN->import
	Make up a URL like http://svn.example.com/svn/paint/trunk
	Add a suitable message like 'Initial import of paint files'.
