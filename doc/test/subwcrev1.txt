SubWCRev  -  A Working Copy Status Tool for Subversion
------------------------------------------------------

SubWCRev is Windows console program which can be used to read the status
of a Subversion working copy and optionally perform keyword substitution
in a template file.

usage: SubWCRev WorkingCopyPath [SrcVersionFile] [DstVersionFile] [-n|-d]

Params:
WorkingCopyPath    :   path to a Subversion working copy
SrcVersionFile     :   path to a template header file
DstVersionFile     :   path to where to save the resulting header file
-n                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will error if the working
                       copy contains local modifications
-d                 :   if given, then SubWCRev will only do its job if
                       DstVersionFile does not exist


SubWCRev reads the Subversion status of all files in a working copy, excluding
externals. It records the highest revision number found, and the commit
timestamp of that revision, and also whether there are local modifications in
the working copy. The revision number and mod status are displayed on stdout.

If a source and destination files are supplied, SubWCRev copies source
to destination, performing keyword substitution as follows:

$WCDATE$ is replaced with the commit date/time of that revision in
international format, ie. yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss

Finally, an optional switch may be added to abort SubWCRev if certain
conditions are not met.

The -d switch causes SubWCRev to abort with ERRORLEVEL 8 if the destination
file already exists.
