RTFM
----
This is a predefined answer to your question. You're getting this 
instead of a real answer to your question because it seems you 
haven't read the documentation yet.
Please read our docs and the FAQ first. If you then still have 
some questions, you can come back to the mailing list and ask 
again. But if you do, make sure you give as much details about 
your problem as possible.
The docs are located here:
http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/docs.html

The FAQ is located here:
http://tortoisesvn.berlios.de/faq/


BUG
---
This is a predefined answer to your bugreport. You're getting this
because you're bug report is either incomplete, indicates a user
error and you should read the docs instead.
Please read about how to report a bug in our FAQ:
http://tortoisesvn.berlios.de/faq/
The documentation is located here:
http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/docs.html

and most important our rules for the mailing list:
http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/list_etiquette.html

If you're done reading that and you still think you've found a bug in
TortoiseSVN then please come back to this mailing list with as much
information as you can give us about the bug.


Etiquette
---------
This is a predefined answer to your mail. You get this because your mail
was written in an offensive tone which doesn't belong on this list.
There are some rules for people using this mailing list. Please read them 
carefully and of course try to follow those rules. Otherwise you might get 
unsubscribed from the list or your mails won't be moderated through anymore.
The rules are located here:
http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/list_etiquette.html


Feature Request:
----------------
This is a predefined answer to your feature request. You're getting this
instead of a real answer because you wrote your request in a very demanding tone.
Requesting a feature should be written friendly, they're after all _requests_ 
and not demands. In an open source project you can't demand a feature. 
The developers don't get paid, they're spending their free time to this
project for free. You're using a free program, you don't pay anything for it.
So please behave civil and ask nicely for a new feature. Explain what you want,
and why you need it. If it makes sense for a majority of users your request will
make it on the todo list. Always keep in mind that we will fix bugs before we 
add new features.
To avoid further problems on this list, please read our rules for this list:
