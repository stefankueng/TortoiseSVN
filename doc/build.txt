To build the docs, you need the following tools:

tools\fop\		- the fop processor
tools\xsl\		- the docbook xsl files from sourceforge
tools\			- xsl processor, hhc.exe, ...

you can download all the required tools as a zip package from our website:
http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=616

Then, make a copy of the file TortoiseVars.tmpl in the TSVN root folder and
rename that copy to TortoiseVars.bat. Then simply adjust the paths as mentioned
in that file.
