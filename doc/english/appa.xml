			<para>

					<listitem>
						<para>If you are using Windows 95 the icon 
				overlays won't appear. You can try the instructions 
				for Windows NT4 below if you like, but it may 
				still not work. Please note: We don't support Windows 95 at
				all - so there may be other issues if you're using that OS
				</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>If you are using Windows NT4, you 
				need to install the IE4 shell or desktop extensions 
				to get a more recent version of Explorer. 
				To do this install IE4, and choose Yes to 
				install the active desktop. Don't worry, you can 
				turn off the actual active desktop later by right 
				clicking on it. It's the new version of Explorer 
				that we are after.</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>If you've already installed IE5, 
				you must either: 
					<orderedlist>
								<listitem>
									<para>Uninstall IE5 and then install IE4 
						with desktop extensions, and then install 
						IE5 again. What a palaver.</para>
								</listitem>
								<listitem>
									<para>Run IE5 setup with command line 
						switches to install the IE4 desktop (shell) 
						extensions.</para>
									<para>The command must be run from the folder that 
						contains the ie5setup.exe file. If the browser 
						appears unstable afterwards just run the 
						IE5 repair function.</para>
									<para>For Win95: ie5setup.exe /c:"ie5wzd /e:IE4Shell WIN /I:Y"</para>

					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>For IE6:</para>
						<para>Run IE6 setup with command line switches to install 
				the IE4 desktop (shell) extensions. The same 
				caveats apply as for IE5. The command must be run from the 
				folder that contains the ie6setup.exe file. 
				For WinNT: ie6setup.exe /c:"ie6wzd /e:IE4Shell NTx86 /I:Y"

					<listitem>
						<para>The shortcut labelled Win NT Explorer

					<listitem>
						<para>If you're using an IntelliPoint mouse 
				driver, and launching Explorer via a mouse click, 
				you need to upgrade from version 3 to version 3.2 or higher

			<para>
			To install the icons you should copy them to the 
			directory where TortoiseSVN was installed. There you 
			can either replace the existing icons or give them 
			new names. If you choose not to overwrite the original 
			ones then you also need to tweak some registry settings. 
			Under <filename>HKLM\Software\TortoiseSVN\</filename> change

			you can do the following: Just create a (DWORD) 
			registry entry under: 
<screen>
HKCU\Software\TortoiseSVN\OwnerdrawnMenus
</screen>
			and set it to 0. This will force TortoiseSVN to use the 
			windows standard routine to draw menu entries.

			<title>How do I uninstall TortoiseSVN?</title>
			<para>
			Simply uninstall from Add/Remove Programs in the Windows 
			control panel. This does not effect your repositories or 
			working copies at all. Be aware however, that the 
			subversion database schema might change before 
			subversion 1.0 is released. When you are working with 
			local repositories (<filename>file:///</filename> URLs), a 
			newer version of TortoiseSVN might be incompatible to 
			an old repository. Please check the subversion release notes.

		<sect2 id="tsvn-faq-installation-7">
			<title>I installed a new version of TortoiseSVN, but 
			the new functions aren't visible?!?</title>
			<para>
			TortoiseSVN is a Windows explorer shell extension. 
			So after updating you <emphasis>must</emphasis> restart 
			windows or at least the explorer process. 
			If you don't then the the explorer process still has the old 
			version of the dll loaded in RAM and uses that old version...

			<title>Can I use TortoiseCVS and TortoiseSVN

			<title>I've got PowerDesk 5 installed

			<para>
			Well, in this case Powerdesk is the bad guy.
			</para>
			<para>
			We sent an assistance request to the people from 
			PD and this is their response (Thanks guys):
			<blockquote>
					<para>
				For now, we suggest the users of the Tortoise shell 
				extension may wish to save off the PD context menu key, 
				and temporarily delete it from the registry while 
				we work on a fix to the PD code. The PD context menu 
				key is here:
<screen>
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\PowerDeskMenu]
</screen>
				Hopefully, removing that key will prevent a shell crash 
				when both apps are on the system. Unfortunately, this 
				will disable the PowerDesk features of the user's 
				shell context menu. We believe the problem to be inside 
				the PD code as we have seen other shell extensions run 
				into similar problems when PD5 is installed. We are 
				working on a fix and we will provide a patch ASAP.

		<title>Daily use questions</title>
		<para>
		This section answers questions about problems you may encounter
		while using TortoiseSVN on a daily basis.
		</para>
		<sect2 id="tsvn-faq-dug-1">
			<title>I accidentally removed a file, and now it's gone!</title>
			<para>
			You can do a <guimenuitem>revert</guimenuitem> on the 
			parent folder where you deleted the file or 
			directory. But use that carefully: you will lose all 
			changes you made in that folder since you last committed! 
			That means not only the file you deleted but changes to other
			files as well!
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="tsvn-faq-dug-2">
			<title>When I remove a file it vanishes, how 
			do I commit it?</title>
			<para>
			Easy, you commit the whole directory! 
			<action>Right&ndash;click</action> in the Explorer window 
			next to the file, and choose <guimenuitem>commit</guimenuitem>. 
			I nearly always commit things from the top level 
			directory &mdash; it is recursive through the whole project. 
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="tsvn-faq-dug-3">
			<title>I always get an error when I check out a single file</title>
			<para>
			There's nothing wrong with it. Subversion only allows you to 
			check out directories &mdash; not files. A warning is not 
			possible because TortoiseSVN has no possibility to check 
			if a URL (e.g. <systemitem class="url">
			http://svn.collab.net/svn/repos/trunk/README</systemitem>) 
			is a file or a folder (ok, it could &mdash; but that would
			take a few seconds to check...). But subversion itself 
			complains if it's a file.... 
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="tsvn-faq-dug-4">
			<title>I'm in trouble renaming a file from 
			UPPERCASE to lowercase</title>
			<para>
			Follow those steps:
			<orderedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>Rename from <filename>UPPERCASE</filename>
				to <filename>UPPERCASE_</filename>
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Commit the changes</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Rename from <filename>UPPERCASE_</filename>
				to <filename>lowercase</filename>
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Commit the changes</para>
					</listitem>
				</orderedlist>
			That way you won't lose the log-history of the file. 
			Just remember to rename it <emphasis>within</emphasis> subversion, 
			i.e. with the special rename command in the TortoiseSVN
			submenu. Just renaming in the explorer will 
			corrupt your working copy!!!
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="tsvn-faq-dug-5">
			<title>I deleted a file and created a file with 
			the same name. Now I can't commit?!?</title>
			<para>
			Your're trying to fool subversion aren't you? No &mdash; seriously 
			&mdash; what did you expect to happen?
			</para>
			<para>
			Assume you're in revision #55.
			</para>
			<para>You removed a file using TortoiseSVN, which told it 
			to mark the file for deletion with the next commit 
			and to remove it from the explorer. It's not really 
			gone from the revision yet. Then you created a file with the 
			same name and added it to TortoiseSVN, which marks the file 
			for adding with the next commit. It's not yet added to the 
			repository. Now you commit. Poor subversion tries to decide 
			whether to add or remove your file at the same time 
			in revision #56. The commit fails.
			</para>
			<para>
			You should have committed immediately after you 
			deleted the file using TortoiseSVN's <guimenuitem>remove
			</guimenuitem> command. You still have no clue what 
			to do? Well, in that case:
			
			<orderedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>Move that file to a safe place</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>Commit your changes. That tells the 
				repository, that the file is gone in the

		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="tsvn-faq-dug-6">
			<title>Can I mix and match with the Subversion 
			command line client or another Subversion client?</title>
			<para>
			Yes, you can change from one client to another 
			whenever you want.
			</para>
		</sect2>
		<sect2 id="tsvn-faq-dug-7">
			<title>Can I work on lots of working copies 
			from different repositories at once?</title>
			<para>
			Yes, you can. This is a standard feature of Subversion. 
			Each directory which was checked out of Subversion remembers 
			where it came from. You can even multiply select 
			working copies which came from different places, and 
			update or commit them all at once. 
			</para>
			<para>
			If you want to have different subdirectories to come 
			from different repositories you can set a 
			special Subversion property called <literal>svn:externals</literal>.
			Please look at the chapter <ulink url="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/html-chunk/ch06s03.html">
					<citetitle>External Definitions</citetitle>
				</ulink>

			<title>How does TortoiseSVN handle conflicts?</title>
			<para>
			Imagine you check out revision 24 of a file and started 
			editing it. In the meantime, someone else committed 
			revision 25, and shortly after that revision 26. You 
			tell TortoiseSVN to update your file now, and Subversion will 
			try to incorporate all the changes between revision 24 
			and 26 into your local file. 
			</para>
			<para>
			But if the changes made between 24 and 26 were too 
			close to or even overlap with the changes you have 
			made, Subversion detects a conflict and creates conflict 
			markers in the file. Subversion also creates three special 
			files for every conflicted file:
			
			<variablelist>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>filename.*.mine</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>This is your file as it existed in your 
					working copy before you updated your working copy
					&mdash; that is, without conflict markers. This file has 
					your latest changes in it and nothing else.
					</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>filename.*.rOLDREV</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>This is the file that was the BASE 
					revision before you updated your working copy. That is,
					it the file that you checked out before you made 
					your latest edits.
					</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>filename.*.rNEWREV</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>This is the file that your Subversion 
					client just received from the server when you updated 
					your working copy. This file corresponds to the HEAD 
					revision of the repository.
					</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
				</variablelist>
			At this point TortoiseSVN will not allow you to commit 
			the conflicted file until you <emphasis>resolved</emphasis> 
			the conflict. To tell TortoiseSVN that you resolved the 
			conflict simply delete the three additional files 
			or use the command <guimenuitem>resolved</guimenuitem> to 
			do that for you.
