			When working on a project, may it be an open-source project where
			several people review your code or a commercial
			project where you sell a component with your sourcecode there will
			be people and customers who find bugs or want to improve your 
			project. To do that they send you patches which you have to review
			and decide if you want to apply them.
		</para>
		<para>
			TortoiseMerge helps you with both those tasks:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Reviewing patches</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Applying the patches</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>
		<para>
			TortoiseMerge also helps you eliminating conflicted files which can
			occur if you're working with a source control system and others
			are working on the same files as you.

		<title>TortoiseMerge is free!</title>
		<para>
			TortoiseMerge is free. You don't have to pay for it, you can use it
			any way you want. It is developed under the GP license (GPL).
		</para>
		<para>
			TortoiseMerge is an Open Source project. That means you have full
			access to the source code of this program. You can browse it
			on this link <ulink url="http://svn.collab.net/repos/tortoisesvn/">
				<citetitle>http://svn.collab.net/repos/tortoisesvn/</citetitle>
			</ulink>. The most recent version (where we're working on) is
			located under <emphasis>/trunk/</emphasis>, the released versions
			are located under <emphasis>/tags/</emphasis>.
		</para>
		<para>
			Even though TortoiseMerge is free, you can support the developers
