  <title>Buttons and Other Controls</title>
  <para>
    Depending on your setting, you either see a toolbar or a ribbon
    with many buttons. The buttons all show a tooltip explaining their
    function when you hover the mouse pointer over them.
  </para>
  <para>
    On the left side of the window is a locator bar. This provides
    a quick visual reference as to where the changes lie within the
    file. The bar has three columns. The left column refers to the
    left pane, the right column to the right pane, and the centre
    column to the bottom pane (if present). In one-pane view only
    the left column is used. The locator bar can also be used as a
    scroll bar to scroll all the windows simultaneously.
  </para>
  <para>
    If you double click on a word then every occurrence of that word will
    be highlighted throughout the document, both in the main panes and the
    locator bar. Double click on the word again to remove the highlighting.
  </para>
  <para>
    If you click in the left margin, or if you triple click within a line,
    that whole line will be selected.
  </para>
  <para>
    Below the bottom window is the status bar. This shows the number of
    lines added and deleted in <literal>Theirs</literal> and
    <literal>Mine</literal>, and the number of unresolved
    conflicts remaining.
  </para>
  <para>
    The status bar also contains combo box controls which indicate how the
    files are handled and treated:
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Encoding</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The encoding specifies how the characters in the views are
            loaded/saved and shown. The most common encoding in English is
            ASCII (which means the local encoding of the OS language), but
            you can change this to be UTF8, UTF16LE, UTF16BE, UTF32LE and
            UTF32BE, both with or without a byte order mark (BOM).
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Line Endings</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The most common line endings on Windows is CRLF, but you can
            change the line endings to whatever you like. Note that if you
            change the line endings, then <emphasis>all</emphasis> line
            endings in the whole file will change, even if when loaded the
            line endings were not all the same.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Tabs</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The option at the top of the combo box menu indicates whether
            tabs or spaces are inserted when you press the tab key.
            The <emphasis>smart tab char</emphasis> option if enabled uses
            an algorithm to determine whether one or the other is best used.
          </para>
          <para>
            The tab size specifies how many space chars are inserted when
            editing and pressing the tab char, or how many chars the next
            word is indented when a tab char is encountered.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
