    <title>Viewing Modes</title>
    <para>
        TortoiseMerge has three main viewing modes: one-pane, two-pane
        and three-pane view. One/two-pane view is used to view changes
        and three-pane view is used to resolve conflicts.

        <para>
            The two pane view has some features which are not available
            in the one pane view:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        Changes inside the modified lines are shown in different
                        colors. Added string parts are shown with a lighter color,
                        but you can of course configure the colors used here.
                        Removed parts are indicated with a dark brown vertical
                        line in the string. Check out the screenshot above to
                        see how this works.

                    <para>
                        Code reorganization usually means a lot of changes in whitespaces
                        (space, tab, newlines) but no actual code change. For example,
                        you split up a very long line into several lines, or you sometimes
                        compact several lines together into one.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Such changes are marked with a white circle symbol on the left side
                        of the views. If you see such a white circle, you know immediately
                        that no real code change is there and you don't have to check the
                        changed block further.

                        Hand editing of the file in the right pane is possible in two-pane
                        view. Such changes are marked with a pencil symbol.
                        Hand editing of the file in the left pane is also possible, only
                        when <guibutton>Enable Edit </guibutton> is pressed when the left
                        pane is active.

        <para>
            If you want to compare/merge three files, TortoiseMerge
            will show you the differences in a three pane view. This view
            is also used if you need to resolve conflicted files.

        </figure>
        <para>
            The left pane shows you the differences between
            <emphasis>Their</emphasis> file and the <emphasis>Base</emphasis>
            file, while the right pane shows you the differences between
            <emphasis>Mine</emphasis> file and the <emphasis>Base</emphasis>
            file. The bottom pane shows you the result of merging
            <emphasis>Base</emphasis>, <emphasis>Mine</emphasis> and
            <emphasis>Theirs</emphasis> with possible conflicts.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you hover the mouse over the pane title, a tooltip will
            show the filenames used for the diff in each pane.
        </para>
        <para>
            Hand editing of the file in the left pane or right pane is also possible, only
            when <guibutton>Enable Edit </guibutton> is pressed when that pane is active.

        <?dbhh topicname="HIDD_FILEPATCHES"?>
        <para>
            After TortoiseMerge parses the patch file it will show
            you a small window with all the files which have changes
            according to the patch file.
            <figure id="tmerge-dug-dia-patch">

            </figure>
            If the filename is shown in black, then the patch can be applied
            without any problems. That means the file is not outdated
            according to the patch.
            However, if the filename is shown in red, then the patch can't
            get applied directly because you already changed that file.
        </para>
        <para>
            The patch file window has a context menu which allows you to
            preview the effect of the patch on the current file
            (apply without saving), to apply and save the changes
            for the selected file, or to apply and save changes to
            <emphasis>all</emphasis> files in the list.
            The double click action is to preview.
