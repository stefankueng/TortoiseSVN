      TortoiseMerge is a free/open-source application. It lets you see
      differences in text files, merge those changes and even review and
      apply unified diff files, often called <firstterm>patches</firstterm>.
    </para>
    <para>
      While working on text files, e.g. source files in your favourite
      programming language, or html/xml files for your documentation or
      website, you will often have a situation where you need to compare
      different versions of those files. Sometimes you get a different
      version from someone else, sometimes you just want to see the changes
      you've made.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you're working with a version control system (e.g. Subversion)
      then you sometimes get <emphasis>conflicts</emphasis> when you
      update your working copy. This happens if someone else changed the
      same parts of the file you're currently working on as you did.
      Then you have to resolve those conflicts manually. This is where
      TortoiseMerge can help you.
    </para>
    <para>
      The following diagram shows you the relationships between the
      files involved in a conflict:

    <title>TortoiseMerge's History</title>
    <para>
      While working on
      <ulink url="http://tortoisesvn.net">
        <citetitle>TortoiseSVN</citetitle>
      </ulink>
      we found that whenever users sent in patches to enhance the project
      or just to fix bugs, we had a lot of work just applying those
      patches. And many times those patches were outdated and couldn't
      be applied with the command line patch tool
      <ulink url="http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/">
        <citetitle>http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/</citetitle>
      </ulink>
      because we were working on those files and had sometimes changed
      those files already.
    </para>
    <para>
      This was also the main reason why TortoiseSVN did not originally
      have a
      <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
        <guimenuitem>Create Patch</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice>
      implemented: we preferred users to send us the whole files because
      with those it was easier to apply patches.
    </para>
    <para>
      So we spent a lot of time, searching the Internet for a GUI tool
      which could apply patch files, but all we found was that such a tool
      didn't exist. So to cut a long story short: We decided that if
      no-one else could provide such a tool we would have to write our
      own. That's when TortoiseMerge was born.
    </para>
    <para>
      Since TortoiseSVN already uses the Subversion library, which has a
      nice diffing engine built in, it was just natural to use this
      library instead of the GNU diff.
    </para>
    <para>
      Subversion 1.7 introduced the <emphasis>svn patch</emphasis> command
      which allows to apply a patch file to a working copy. TortoiseMerge
      uses now the same functions as the Subversion command to avoid different
      behaviors between the two.
