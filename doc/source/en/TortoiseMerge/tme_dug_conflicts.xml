	<title>Merging / Editing Conflicts</title>
	<para>
		TortoiseMerge not only <emphasis>shows</emphasis> you the differences
		between files but also lets you resolve conflicts or apply changes.
	</para>
	<para>
		If you're in two pane view, then you can only edit the file in the
		right pane (<literal>Mine</literal>). To apply changes made in the
		left file (<literal>Theirs</literal>),
		<action>right-click</action> on the changed lines and select
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Use text block from <quote>theirs</quote>
			</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>.
		Then the changes from the left file are added to the right file.
	</para>
	<para>
		Sometimes you actually want both text blocks, and the context menu
		also offers you
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Use both text blocks (this one first)</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		and
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Use both text blocks (this one last)</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>.
	</para>
	<para>
		If you're in three pane view (sometimes called
		<emphasis>merge view</emphasis>) you can only edit the file in the
		bottom view (<literal>Merged</literal>). As in two pane view,
		you can <action>right-click</action> on conflicted
		lines and either select
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Use text block from <quote>theirs</quote>
			</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		or
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Use text block from <quote>mine</quote>
			</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>.
		In addition, if you want <emphasis>both</emphasis> blocks, you can
		select
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>
				Use text block from <quote>mine</quote>
				before <quote>theirs</quote>
			</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		or
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>
				Use text block from <quote>theirs</quote>
				before <quote>mine</quote>
			</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>.
		According to the command you've selected, the changes are used
		in the resulting <literal>Merged</literal> file.
	</para>
	<para>
		Sometimes the conflict is too difficult to resolve by simply picking
		<literal>Theirs</literal> and <literal>Mine</literal> and it
		requires hand editing. TortoiseMerge allows you to do all the easy
		changes visually first and then save the file, leaving only the
		difficult changes to be resolved by hand-editing.
	</para>
	<important>
		<para>
			Note that if you use TortoiseMerge on the same files again,
			any changes to your working copy, whether in TortoiseMerge,
			or by hand-editing, <emphasis>will be discarded</emphasis>
			and the file will appear as it did when conflict-editing
			first started.
		</para>
	</important>
	<para>
		If you need to copy lines of text to insert in another file using
		your favourite text editor, you can select multiple lines to copy
		within TortoiseMerge. <action>Click</action> on the first line of
		the block, then <action>Shift+Click</action> on the last line of
		the block. As usual, <action>Ctrl+C</action> can be used to copy
		the selected lines to the clipboard.
