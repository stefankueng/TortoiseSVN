	<title>Automating TortoiseMerge</title>
	<simplesect>
		<para>
			TortoiseMerge can be started with command line parameters to avoid having
			to go through the <guilabel>Open</guilabel> dialog to select the files 
			yourself. This is useful also if you want to use TortoiseMerge from 
			another application.

			Most switches require additional information like a path or some
			other string. In those cases, append an ':' to the switch and put
			the string/path after it. Example:
<screen>
/base:"c:\folder\my base file.txt"
</screen>

Don't touch these lines:
<entry condition="pot">/about</entry>

  The condition="pot" prevents the strings from being extracted into
  the .pot file, so nobody translates them.
  The colons in front of the command have to stay there to prevent these strings
  from being translated if the po file "by chance" contains a matching translation.
