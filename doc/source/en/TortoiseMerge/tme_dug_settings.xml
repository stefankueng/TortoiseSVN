        <para>
            Most of the options here are self-explanatory, but a few
            points need clarifying.
        </para>
        <para>
            <guilabel>Backup original file</guilabel>
            renames the original file in the WC to <literal>filename.bak</literal>
            before saving the modified version.
        </para>
        <para>
            <guilabel>Default to UTF-8 encoding</guilabel>
            when set, ANSI files are loaded as UTF-8 encoded and saved as
            such when edited.
        </para>
        <para>
            <guilabel>Max line length for inline diffs</guilabel>
            TortoiseMerge can get slow when showing inline diffs for
            very long lines. Because of that only lines that are shorter
            than 3000 chars are shown with inline diffs. You can change
            this value here.
        </para>
        <para>
            <guilabel>Ignore line endings</guilabel>
            hides changes which are due solely to difference in line-end style.
        </para>
        <para>
            <guilabel>Ignore case changes</guilabel>
            hides changes which are due solely to case changes within the text.
            This can be useful with apps such as Visual Basic, which changes
            case in variables without warning.
