		<title>Audience</title>
		<para>
			This book is written for computer literate folk who want to
			use Subversion to manage their data, but are uncomfortable using the
			command line client to do so. Since TortoiseSVN is a windows shell
			extension it's assumed that the user is familiar with the windows
			explorer and knows how to use it.

		<title>Reading Guide</title>
		<para>
			This <emphasis>Preface</emphasis> explains a little about the
			TortoiseSVN project, the community of people who work on it, and
			the licensing conditions for using it and distributing it.
		</para>
		<para>
			The <emphasis>Introduction</emphasis> explains what TOrtoiseSVN is,
			what it does, where it comes from and the basics for installing it
			on your PC.
		</para>
		<para>
			In <emphasis>Basic Concepts</emphasis> we give a short introduction
			to the <emphasis>Subversion</emphasis> revision control system which
			underlies TortoiseSVN. This is borrowed from the documentation for the
			Subversion project and explains the different approaches to version
			control, and how Subversion works.
		</para>
		<para>
			Even most Subversion users will never have to set up a server themselves.
			The next chapter deals with how to set up such a server, and is useful
			for administrators.
		</para>
		<para>
			The chapter on <emphasis>The Repository</emphasis> explains how to set up
			a local repository, which is useful for testing Subversion and TortoiseSVN
			using a single PC. It also explains a bit about repository administration
			which is also relevant to repositories located on a server.
		</para>
		<para>
			The <emphasis>Daily Use Guide</emphasis> is the most important section as
			it explains all the main features of TortoiseSVN and how to use them.
			It takes the form of a tutorial, starting with checking out a working copy,
			modifying it, committing your changes, etc. It then progresses to more
			advanced topics.
		</para>
		<para>
			<emphasis>SubWCRev</emphasis> is a separate program included with TortoiseSVN
			which can extract the information from your working copy and write it into a
			file. This is useful for including build information in your projects.
		</para>
		<para>
			The <emphasis>How Do I...</emphasis> section answers some common questions
			about performing tasks which are not explicitly covered elsewhere.
		</para>
		<para>
			The section on <emphasis>Automating TortoiseSVN</emphasis> shows how the
			TortoiseSVN GUI dialogs can be called from the command line. This is useful
			for scripting where you still need user interaction.
		</para>
		<para>
			The <emphasis>Command Line Cross Reference</emphasis> give a correlation
			between TortoiseSVN commands and their equivalents in the Subversion
			command line client <literal>svn.exe</literal>.
