        If a Subversion command cannot complete successfully, perhaps
        due to server problems, your working copy can be left in an
        inconsistent state. In that case you need to use
        <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Cleanup</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        on the folder. It is a good idea to do this at the top level
        of the working copy.
    </para>
    <para>
        Cleanup has another useful side effect. If a file date changes
        but its content doesn't, Subversion cannot tell whether it has
        really changed except by doing a byte-by-byte comparison with
        the pristine copy. If you have a lot of files in this state it
        makes acquiring status very slow, which will make many dialogs
        slow to respond. Executing a Cleanup on your working copy will
        repair these <quote>broken</quote> timestamps and restore
        status checks to full speed.
