					<para>
						Global ignore patterns are used to prevent unversioned files from
						showing up e.g. in the commit dialog. Files matching the
						patterns are also ignored by an import.
						Ignore files or directories by typing in the names or extensions.
						Patterns are separated by spaces e.g.
						<literal>*/bin */obj *.bak *.~?? *.jar *.[Tt]mp</literal>.
						The first two entries refer to directories, the 
						other four to files.
						These patterns use filename globbing. Read
						<xref linkend="tsvn-dug-ignore-glob"/> for more information.
					</para>
					<para>
						Note that the ignore patterns you specify here will also
						affect other Subversion clients running on your PC, including
						the command line client.
					</para>
					<caution>
						<para>
						If you use the Subversion configuration file to set
						a <literal>global-ignores</literal> pattern, it will

						configuration file is accessed using the
						<guibutton>Edit</guibutton> as described below.
						</para>
					</caution>
					<para>
						This ignore pattern will affect all your projects.
						It is not versioned, so it will not affect other users.
						By contrast you can also use the versioned
						<literal>svn:ignore</literal> property to exclude
						files or directories from version control. Read
						<xref linkend="tsvn-dug-ignore"/>

				<listitem>
					<para>
						This option tells TortoiseSVN to set the filedates to
						the last commit time when doing a checkout or an update.
						Otherwise TortoiseSVN will use the current date.
						If you are developing software it is generally best
						to use the current date because build systems normally
						look at the datestamps to decide which files need
						compiling. If you use "last commit time" and revert
						to an older file revision, your project may not compile
						as you expect it to.

			If you have a very large number of files in your working copy

			folder status. To avoid this delay you can uncheck the
			<guilabel>Fetch status for context menu</guilabel>
			box. Be warned that the context menu for folders will not always
			be correct, and may include items which should not really be there.

			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>

			<para>
				<figure id="tsvn-dug-settings-dia-overlay">
					<title>The Settings Dialog, Look and Feel Page</title>
					<graphic fileref="../images/SettingsOverlay.png"/>
				</figure>
				This page allows you to choose the items for which TortoiseSVN will
				display icon overlays. Network drives can be very slow, so by default
				icons are not shown for working copies located on network shares.
				You can even disable all icon overlays, but where's the fun in that?
			</para>
			<para>
				USB Flash drives appear to be a special case in that the drive type
				is identified by the device itself. Some appear as fixed drives,
				and some as removable drives.
			</para>
			<para>
				By default, overlay icons will appear in all open/save dialogs
				as well as in Windows Explorer. If you want them to appear
				<emphasis>only</emphasis> in Windows Explorer, check the
				<guilabel>Show overlays only in explorer</guilabel> box.
			</para>
			<para>
				Since it takes quite a while to fetch the status of a working copy,
				TortoiseSVN uses a cache to store the status in so the explorer
				doesn't get hogged too much when showing the overlays.
				You can choose which type of cache TortoiseSVN should use according
				to your system and working copy size here:
				<variablelist>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>Default</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								Caches all status information in a separate process
								(<filename>TSVNCache.exe</filename>). That process
								watches all drives for changes and fetches the status
								again if files inside a working copy get modified.
								The process runs with the least possible priority so
								other programs don't get hogged because of it. That 
								also means that the status information is not
								<emphasis>realtime</emphasis> but it can take a few
								seconds for the overlays to change.
							</para>
							<para>
								Advantage: the overlays show the status recursively,
								i.e. if a file deep inside a working copy is modified,
								all folders up to the working copy root will also
								show the modified overlay. And since the process can
								send notifications to the shell, the overlays on the left
								treeview usually change too.
							</para>
							<para>
								Disadvantage: the process runs constantly, even if you're not 
								working on your projects. It also uses around 10-50 MB of RAM 
								depending on number and size of your working copies.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>Shell</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								Caching is done directly inside the shell extension
								dll, but only for the currently visible folder.
								Each time you navigate to another folder, the status
								information is fetched again.
							</para>
							<para>
								Advantage: needs only very little memory (around 1 MB of RAM)
								and can show the status in <emphasis>realtime</emphasis>.
							</para>
							<para>
								Disadvantage: Since only one folder is cached, the overlays
								don't show the status recursively. For big working copies,
								it can take more time to show a folder in explorer than
								with the default cache. Also the mime-type column is not
								available.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>None</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								With this setting, the TortoiseSVN does not fetch the status
								at all in Explorer. Because of that, files don't get an overlay
								and folders only get a 'normal' overlay if they're versioned.
								No other overlays are shown, and no extra columns are available
								either.
							</para>
							<para>
								Advantage: uses absolutely no additional memory and does
								not slow down the Explorer at all while browsing.
							</para>
							<para>
								Disadvantage: Status information of files and folders is not
								shown in Explorer. To see if your working copies are modified,
								you have to use the "Check for modifications" dialog.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
				</variablelist>
			</para>
			<para>
				If you select the default option, you can also choose to mark folders as
				modified if they contain unversioned items. This could be useful for
				reminding you that you have created new files which are not yet versioned.
			</para>
			<para>
				The <guilabel>Exclude Paths</guilabel> are used to tell TortoiseSVN
				those paths for which it should <emphasis>not</emphasis> show icon
				overlays and status columns.
				This is useful if you have some very big working copies containing
				only libraries which you won't change at all and therefore don't
				need the overlays. For example:
			</para>
			<para>
				<filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion</filename> will disable
				the overlays <emphasis>only</emphasis> on that specific folder. You
				still can see the overlays on all files and folder inside that folder.
			</para>
			<para>
				<filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion*</filename> will disable the
				overlays on <emphasis>all</emphasis> files and folders whose path
				starts with <filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion</filename>. That
				means you won't see overlays for any files and folders below that
				path.
			</para>
			<para>
				The same applies to the <guilabel>Include Paths</guilabel>. Except that
				for those paths the overlays are shown even if the overlays are disabled
				for that specific drive type, or by an exclude path specified above.
			</para>
			<para>
				TSVNCache.exe also uses these paths to restrict its scanning. If you
				want it to look only in particular folders, disable all drive types
				and include only the folders you specifically want to be scanned.

							TortoiseSVN can automatically close all progress dialogs

							<guilabel>Close manually</guilabel>
							which allows you to review all messages and check what
							has happened. However, you may decide that you want to
							ignore some types of message and have the dialog
							close automatically if there are no critical changes.
						</para>
						<para>
							<guilabel>Auto-close if no merges, adds or deletes</guilabel>
							means that the progress dialog will close if there were
							simple updates, but if changes from the repository were

							the dialog will remain open. It will also stay open if
							there were any conflicts or errors during the operation.
						</para>

						<para>
							<guilabel>Auto-close if no conflicts</guilabel>

						</para>
						<para>
							<guilabel>Auto-close if no errors</guilabel>
							always closes the dialog even if there were conflicts.
							The only condition that keeps the dialog open is an

			You can also specify which program TortoiseSVN should use to
			establish a secure connection to a svn+ssh repository.
			We recommend that you use TortoisePlink.exe. This is a version
			of the popular Plink program, and is included with TortoiseSVN,
			but it is compiled as a Windowless app, so you don't get a DOS
			box popping up every time you authenticate.
		</para>
		<para>
			One side-effect of not having a window is that there is
			nowhere for any error messages to go, so if authentication
			fails you will simply get a message saying something like
			<quote>Unable to write to standard output</quote>.
			For this reason we recommend that you first set up using
			standard Plink. When everything is working, you can use
			TortoisePlink with exactly the same parameters.

				An external diff program may be used for comparing different
				revisions of files. The external program will need to
				obtain the filenames from the command line, along with
				any other command line options. TortoiseSVN uses
				substitution parameters prefixed with <literal>%</literal>.
				When it encounters one of these it will substitute the
				appropriate value. The order of the parameters will depend
				on the Diff program you use.

				The window titles are not pure filenames.
				TortoiseSVN treats that as a name to display and creates
				the names accordingly. So e.g. if you're doing a
				diff from a file in revision 123 with a file 
				in your working copy, the names will be
				<filename>filename : revision 123</filename>
				and
				<filename>filename : working copy</filename>

			</para>
			<para>
				If you use the <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property to
				expand keywords, and in particular the <literal>revision</literal>
				of a file, then there may be a difference between files which
				is purely due to the current value of the keyword. Also if you use
				<literal>svn:eol-style = native</literal> the BAsE file will have
				pure <literal>LF</literal> line endings whereas your file will
				have <literal>CR-LF</literal> line endings. TSVN will normally hide
				these differences automatically by first parsing the BASE file to
				expand keywords and line endings before doing the diff operation.
				However, this can take a long time with large files. If
				<guilabel>Convert files when diffing against BASE</guilabel>
				is unchecked then TSVN will skip pre-processing the files.
