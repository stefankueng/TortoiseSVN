		Sometimes you want to have more detailed information
		about a file/directory than just the icon overlay.
		You can get all the information Subversion provides in the
		explorer properties dialog. Just select the file or
		directory and select
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Windows Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>properties</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		in the context menu (note: this is the normal properties menu entry
		the explorer provides, not the one in the TortoiseSVN submenu!).
		In the properties dialog box TortoiseSVN has added a new
		property page for files/folders under Subversion control,
		where you can see all relevant information about the
		selected file/directory.

			</para>
			<para>
				Some properties, for example <literal>svn:needs-lock</literal>,

			<title>Exporting and Importing Properties</title>
			<para>
				Often you will find yourself applying the same set of properties many

				can use the Export/Import feature.
			</para>

				to the folders non-recursively.
			</para>
			<para>
				If you want to add properties to a tree recursively, follow the steps

			<para>
				The Import file format is binary and proprietary to TortoiseSVN.
				Its only purpose is to transfer properties using Import and Export,
				so there is no need to edit these files.
			</para>
		</sect3>
		<sect3 id="tsvn-dug-propertypage-props-binary">
			<title>Binary Properties</title>
			<para>
				TortoiseSVN can handle binary property values using files.
				To read a binary property value, <guibutton>Save...</guibutton>
				to a file. To set a binary value, use a hex editor or other appropriate
				tool to create a file with the content you require, then
				<guibutton>Load...</guibutton> from that file.
			</para>
			<para>
				Although binary properties are not often used, they can be useful in
				some applications. For example if you are storing huge graphics files,
				or if the application used to load the file is huge, you might want
				to store a thumbnail as a property so you can obtain a preview quickly.

			<title>Conflicts on properties</title>
			<para>

			TortoiseSVN has a few special properties of its own, and these begin
			with <literal>tsvn:</literal>.
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<literal>tsvn:logminsize</literal>
						sets the minimum length of a log message for a commit.
						If you enter a shorter message than specified here, the commit
						is disabled. This feature is very useful for reminding you to
						supply a proper descriptive message for every commit.
						If this property is not set,
						or the value is zero, empty log messages are allowed.
					</para>
					<para>
						<literal>tsvn:lockmsgminsize</literal>
						sets the minimum length of a lock message.
						If you enter a shorter message than specified here, the lock
						is disabled. This feature is very useful for reminding you to
						supply a proper descriptive message for every lock you get.
						If this property is not set,
						or the value is zero, empty lock messages are allowed.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<literal>tsvn:logwidthmarker</literal> is used with projects which
						require log messages to be formatted with some maximum width
						(typically 80 characters) before a line break. Setting this
						property to a non-zero will do 2 things in the log message
						entry dialog: it places a marker to indicate the maximum width,
						and it disables word wrap in the display, so that you can see
						whether the text you entered is too long. Note: this feature
						will only work correctly if you have a fixed-width font
						selected for log messages.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<literal>tsvn:logtemplate</literal> is used with projects which
						have rules about log message formatting. The property holds
						a multi-line text string which will be inserted in the commit
						message box when you start a commit. You can then edit it to
						include the required information. Note: if you are also using
						<literal>tsvn:logminsize</literal>, be sure to set the length
						longer than the template or you will lose the protection mechanism.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Subversion allows you to set <quote>autoprops</quote> which
						will be applied to newly added or imported files, based on
						the file extension. This depends on every client having set
						appropriate autoprops in their subversion configuration file.
						<literal>tsvn:autoprops</literal> can be set on folders
						and these will be merged with the user's local autoprops
						when importing or adding files.
					</para>
					<para>
						If there is a conflict between the local autoprops and
						<literal>tsvn:autoprops</literal>, the project settings take
						precedence because they are specific to that project.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						In the Commit dialog you have the option to paste in the
						list of changed files, including the status of each file
						(added, modified, etc).
						<literal>tsvn:logfilelistenglish</literal> defines whether
						the file status is inserted in English or in the localized
						language. If the property is not set, the default is
						<literal>true</literal>.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						TortoiseSVN can use spell checker modules which are also
						used by OpenOffice and Mozilla. If you have those installed
						this property will determine which spell checker to use, i.e.
						in which language the log messages for your project should
						be written.
						<literal>tsvn:projectlanguage</literal> sets the language
						module the spell checking engine should use when you enter
						a log message. You can find the values for your language
						on this page:
						<ulink url="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms776260.aspx">
							<citetitle>MSDN: Language Identifiers</citetitle>
						</ulink>.
					</para>
					<para>
						You can enter this value in decimal, or in hexadecimal if
						prefixed with <literal>0x</literal>.
						For example English (US) can be entered as
						<literal>0x0409</literal> or <literal>1033</literal>.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The property <literal>tsvn:logsummary</literal> is used to
						extract a portion of the log message which is then shown
						in the log dialog as the log message summary.
					</para>
					<para>
						The value of the <literal>tsvn:logsummary</literal> property
						must be set to a one line regex string which contains one
						regex group. Whatever matches that group is used as the
						summary.
					</para>
					<para>
						An example: 
						<literal>\[SUMMARY\]:\s+(.*)</literal> 
						Will catch everything after <quote>[SUMMARY]</quote> in the log message
						and use that as the summary.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						When you want to add a new property, you can either pick one from
						the list in the combo box, or you can enter any property name
						you like. If your project uses some custom properties,
						and you want those properties to appear in the list in the combo
						box (to avoid typos when you enter a property name), you can
						create a list of your custom properties using
						<literal>tsvn:userfileproperties</literal> and
						<literal>tsvn:userdirproperties</literal>.
						Apply these properties to a folder. When you go to edit
						the properties of any child item, your custom properties will
						appear in the list of pre-defined property names.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>
		<para>
			Some <literal>tsvn:</literal> properties require a
			<literal>true/false</literal> value. TortoiseSVN also understands
			<literal>yes</literal> as a synonym for <literal>true</literal> and
			<literal>no</literal> as a synonym for <literal>false</literal>.
		</para>
		<para>
			TortoiseSVN can integrate with some bug tracking tools. This uses
			project properties that start with <literal>bugtraq:</literal>.
			Read <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-bugtracker"/> for further information.
		</para>
		<para>
			It can also integrate with some web-based repository browsers,
			using project properties that start with <literal>webviewer:</literal>.
			Read <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-repoviewer"/> for further information.
		</para>
		<important>
			<title>Set the project properties on folders</title>
			<para>
				These special project properties must be set on
				<emphasis>folders</emphasis> for the system to work. 
				When you commit a file or folder the properties are read from that folder.
				If the properties are not found there, TortoiseSVN will search upwards
				through the folder tree to find them until it comes to an unversioned
				folder, or the tree root (eg. <literal>C:\</literal>) is found.
				If you can be sure that each user checks out only from e.g
				<filename>trunk/</filename> and not some sub-folder, then it is
				sufficient to set the properties on <filename>trunk/</filename>.
				If you can't be sure, you should set the properties recursively on each sub-folder.
				A property setting deeper in the project hierarchy overrides settings on
				higher levels (closer to <filename>trunk/</filename>).
			</para>
			<para>
				For project properties <emphasis>only</emphasis>
				you can use the <guilabel>Recursive</guilabel> checkbox to set
				the property to all sub-folders in the hierarchy, without also
				setting it on all files.
			</para>
		</important>
		<para>
			When you add new sub-folders using TortoiseSVN, any
			project properties present in the parent folder
			will automatically be added to the new child folder too.
		</para>
		<caution>
			<para>
				Although TortoiseSVN's project properties are extremely useful,
				they only work with TortoiseSVN, and some will only work in newer versions
				of TortoiseSVN. If people working on your project use a variety of
				Subversion clients, or possibly have old versions of TortoiseSVN,
				you may want to use repository hooks to enforce project policies.
				project properties can only help to implement a
				policy, they cannot enforce it.
