		Sometimes you want to have more detailed information
		about a file/directory than just the icon overlay.
		You can get all the information Subversion provides in the
		explorer properties dialog. Just select the file or
		directory and select
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Windows Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>properties</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		in the context menu (note: this is the normal properties menu entry
		the explorer provides, not the one in the TortoiseSVN submenu!).
		In the properties dialog box TortoiseSVN has added a new
		property page for files/folders under Subversion control,
		where you can see all relevant information about the
		selected file/directory.

            You can add your own properties, or some properties with a 
            special meaning in Subversion. These begin with <literal>svn:</literal>. 
            <literal>svn:externals</literal> is such a property; see how to handle
            externals in <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-import-4"/>.

            in the box below. Properties which take multiple values, such as an
            ignore list, can be entered on multiple lines.

        <para>
            Some properties, for example <literal>svn:needs-lock</literal>,
            can only be applied to files, so the property name doesn't appear
            in the drop down list for folders. You can still apply such a
            property recursively to all files in a hierarchy, but you have
            to type in the property name yourself.

        <para>
            If you wish to edit an existing property, select that property from

            The <literal>svn:externals</literal> property can be used to

            TortoiseSVN can handle binary property values using files.
            To read a binary property value, <guibutton>Save...</guibutton>
            to a file. To set a binary value, use a hex editor or other appropriate
            tool to create a file with the content you require, then
            <guibutton>Load...</guibutton> from that file.
        </para>
        <para>
            Although binary properties are not often used, they can be useful in
            some applications. For example if you are storing huge graphics files,
            or if the application used to load the file is huge, you might want
            to store a thumbnail as a property so you can obtain a preview quickly.

                If there's a conflict on committing the changes, because another

        <para>
            TortoiseSVN has a few special properties of its own, and these begin

                        sets the minimum length of a log message for a commit.
                        If you enter a shorter message than specified here, the commit
                        is disabled. This feature is very useful for reminding you to
                        supply a proper descriptive message for every commit.
                        If this property is not set,
                        or the value is zero, empty log messages are allowed.

                        sets the minimum length of a lock message.
                        If you enter a shorter message than specified here, the lock
                        is disabled. This feature is very useful for reminding you to

                        If this property is not set,
                        or the value is zero, empty lock messages are allowed.

                        <literal>tsvn:logwidthmarker</literal> is used with projects which
                        require log messages to be formatted with some maximum width
                        (typically 80 characters) before a line break. Setting this
                        property to a non-zero will do 2 things in the log message
                        entry dialog: it places a marker to indicate the maximum width,
                        and it disables word wrap in the display, so that you can see
                        whether the text you entered is too long. Note: this feature
                        will only work correctly if you have a fixed-width font
                        selected for log messages.

                        have rules about log message formatting. The property holds
                        a multi-line text string which will be inserted in the commit
                        message box when you start a commit. You can then edit it to

                        <literal>tsvn:logminsize</literal>, be sure to set the length
                        longer than the template or you will lose the protection mechanism.

                        this property will determine which spell checker to use, i.e.

            Some <literal>tsvn:</literal> properties require a

                <emphasis>folders</emphasis> for the system to work. 
                When you commit a file or folder the properties are read from that folder.
                If the properties are not found there, TortoiseSVN will search upwards
                through the folder tree to find them until it comes to an unversioned
                folder, or the tree root (eg. <literal>C:\</literal>) is found.
                If you can be sure that each user checks out only from e.g
                <filename>trunk/</filename> and not some subfolder, then it is
                sufficient to set the properties on <filename>trunk/</filename>.
                If you can't be sure, you should set the properties recursively on each subfolder.
                A property setting deeper in the project hierarchy overrides settings on
                higher levels (closer to <filename>trunk/</filename>).
