		VS.NET when used with web projects can't handle the <literal>.svn</literal>
		folders that Subversion uses to store its internal information.
		This is not a bug in Subversion. The bug is in VS.NET and the frontpage
		extensions it uses.

		As of Version 1.3.0 of Subversion and TortoiseSVN, you can set
		the environment variable <literal>SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK</literal>.
		If that variable is set, then Subversion will use <literal>_svn</literal>
		folders instead of <literal>.svn</literal> folders. You must restart
		your shell for that env variable to take effect. Normally that means
		rebooting your PC. To make this easier, you can now do this from
		the general settings page using a simple checkbox - 
		refer to <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-settings-main"/>.
