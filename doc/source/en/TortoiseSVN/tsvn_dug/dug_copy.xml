		It often happens that you already have the files you need in another
		project in your repository, and you simply want to copy them across.
		You could simply copy the files and add them as described above, but
		that would not give you any history. And if you subsequently fix a bug
		in the original files, you can only merge the fix automatically if the
		new copy is related to the original in Subversion.

		The easiest way to copy files and folders from within a working copy is
		to use the right-drag menu. When you <action>right-drag</action> a file
		or folder from one working copy to another, or even within the same
		folder, a context menu appears when you release the mouse.

		</figure>
		Now you can copy existing versioned content to a new location, possibly
		renaming it at the same time.

		You can also use the repository browser to locate content you want,
		and copy it into your working copy directly from the repository.
		Refer to <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-repobrowser"/> to find out more.
