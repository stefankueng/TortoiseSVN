    <para>
        If you want to export all your client settings to use on another computer
        you can do so using the Windows registry editor <filename>regedt32.exe</filename>.
        Go to the registry key <literal>HKCU\Software\TortoiseSVN</literal> and export it
        to a reg file. On the other computer, just import that file again (usually, a
        double click on the reg file will do that).

        Remember to save Subversion's general settings, which you can find in the Subversion
        configuration file <literal>%APPDATA%\Subversion\config</literal>.
