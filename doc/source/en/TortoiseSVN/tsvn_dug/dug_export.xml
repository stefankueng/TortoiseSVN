    <para>
        Sometimes you may want a clean copy of your working tree without the
        <filename>.svn</filename> directory, e.g. to create a zipped
        tarball of your source, or to export to a web server. Instead of
        making a copy and then deleting the <filename>.svn</filename>
        directory manually, TortoiseSVN offers the command
        <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Export...</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>.
        Exporting from a URL and exporting from a working copy are treated
        slightly differently.
    </para>
    <para>
        <figure id="tsvn-dug-export-dia-1">
            <title>The Export-from-URL Dialog</title>
            <graphic fileref="../images/ExportURL.png"/>
        </figure>
        If you execute this command on an unversioned folder, TortoiseSVN will
        assume that the selected folder is the target, and open a dialog for
        you to enter the URL and revision to export from.
        This dialog has options to export only the top level folder, to omit
        external references, and to override the line end style for files which
        have the <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> property set.
    </para>
    <para>
        Of course you can export directly from the repository too.
        Use the Repository Browser to navigate to the relevant subtree
        in your repository, then use
        <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Export</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>.
        You will get the <guilabel>Export from URL</guilabel> dialog described above.
    </para>
    <para>
        If you execute this command on your working copy you'll be asked for
        a place to save the <emphasis>clean</emphasis> working copy without the
        <filename>.svn</filename> folder.
        By default, only the versioned files are exported, but you can use the
        <guilabel>Export unversioned files too</guilabel> checkbox to include any other
        unversioned files which exist in your WC and not in the repository.
        External references using <literal>svn:externals</literal> can be
        omitted if required.
    </para>
    <para>
        Another way to export from a working copy is to <action>right drag</action>
        the working copy folder to another location and choose
        <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>SVN Export versioned items here</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        or
        <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>SVN Export all items here</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        or
        <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>SVN Export changed items here</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>.
        The second option includes the unversioned files as well.
        The third option exports only modified items, but maintains
        the folder structure.
    </para>
    <para>
        When exporting from a working copy,
        if the target folder already contains a folder of the same
        name as the one you are exporting, you will be given the option
        to overwrite the existing content, or to create a new folder with
        an automatically generated name, e.g. <literal>Target (1)</literal>.

        <title>Exporting single files</title>
        <para>
            The export dialog does not allow exporting single files, even
            though Subversion can.
        </para>
        <para>
            To export single files with TortoiseSVN, you have to use
            the repository browser (<xref linkend="tsvn-dug-repobrowser"/>).
            Simply drag the file(s) you want to export from the repository
            browser to where you want them in the explorer, or use the
            context menu in the repository browser to export the files.
        </para>

        <title>Exporting a Change Tree</title>
        <para>
            If you want to export a copy of your project tree structure
            but containing only the files which have changed in a particular
            revision, or between any two revisions, use the compare revisions
            feature described in <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-compare-revs"/>.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you want to export your working copy tree structure
            but containing only the files which are locally modified,
            refer to <guilabel>SVN Export changed items here</guilabel> above.
        </para>

        <title>Removing a working copy from version control</title>

            <primary>unversion</primary>
        </indexterm>
        <para>
            Sometimes you have a working copy which you want to convert back
            to a normal folder without the <literal>.svn</literal> directory.
            All you need to do is delete the <literal>.svn</literal> directory
            from the working copy root.
        </para>
        <para>
            Alternatively you can export the folder to itself.
            In Windows Explorer right drag the working copy root folder from
            the file pane onto itself in the folder pane.
            TortoiseSVN detects this special case and asks if you want to
            make the working copy unversioned. If you answer
            <emphasis>yes</emphasis> the control directory will be removed
            and you will have a plain, unversioned directory tree.
