	<title>Exporting a Subversion Working Copy</title>
	<indexterm>
		<primary>export</primary>
	</indexterm>
	<para>
		Sometimes you may want a copy of your working tree without any of
		those <filename>.svn</filename> directories, e.g. to create a zipped
		tarball of your source, or to export to a web server. Instead of
		making a copy and then deleting all those <filename>.svn</filename>
		directories manually, TortoiseSVN offers the command
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Export...</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>.
		Exporting from a URL and exporting from a working copy are treated
		slightly differently.
	</para>

			<title>The Export-from-URL Dialog</title>
			<graphic fileref="../images/ExportURL.png"/>
		</figure>
		If you execute this command on an unversioned folder, TortoiseSVN will
		assume that the selected folder is the target, and open a dialog for
		you to enter the URL and revision to export from.
		This dialog has options to export only the top level folder, to omit
		external references, and to override the line end style for files which
		have the <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> property set.
	</para>
	<para>
		Of course you can export directly from the repository too.
		Use the Repository Browser to navigate to the relevant subtree
		in your repository, then use
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Export</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>.
		You will get the <guilabel>Export from URL</guilabel> dialog described above.
	</para>
	<para>
		If you execute this command on your working copy you'll be asked for
		a place to save the <emphasis>clean</emphasis> working copy without the
		<filename>.svn</filename> folders.
		By default, only the versioned files are exported, but you can use the
		<guilabel>Export unversioned files too</guilabel> checkbox to include any other
		unversioned files which exist in your WC and not in the repository.
		External references using <literal>svn:externals</literal> can be
		omitted if required.
	</para>
	<para>
		Another way to export from a working copy is to <action>right drag</action>
		the working copy folder to another location and choose
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>SVN Export here</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		or 
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>SVN Export all here</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>.
		The second option includes the unversioned files as well.
	</para>
	<para>
		When exporting from a working copy,
		if the target folder already contains a folder of the same
		name as the one you are exporting, you will be given the option
		to overwrite the existing content, or to create a new folder with
		an automatically generated name, eg. <literal>Target (1)</literal>.
