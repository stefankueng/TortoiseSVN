	<para>
		A few infrequently used settings are available only in the advanced
		page of the settings dialog. These settings modify the registry directly
		and you have to know what each of these settings is used for and what
		it does. Do not modify those settings if you're not sure you need to
		change those.

	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>ConfigDir</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					You can specify a different location for the Subversion
					configuration file here.
					This will affect all TortoiseSVN operations.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>Debug</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Set this to <literal>true</literal> if you want a dialog to
					pop up for every command showing the command line of the command.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
			<term>CacheTrayIcon</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					To add a cache tray icon for the TSVNCache program, set
					this value to <literal>true</literal>.
					This is really only useful for developers as it allows
					you to terminate the program gracefully.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>ShowContextMenuIcons</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					This can be useful if you use something other than the windows explorer
					or if you get problems with the context menu displaying correctly.
					Set this value to <literal>false</literal>
					if you don't want TortoiseSVN to not show icons for the
					shell context menu items. Set this value to <literal>true</literal> to show
					the icons again.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>ShowAppContextMenuIcons</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					If you don't want TortoiseSVN to show icons for the context
					menus in its dialogs, set this value to <literal>false</literal>.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>LogStatusCheck</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The log dialog shows the revision the working copy path
					is at in bold. But this requires that the log dialog fetches
					the status of that path. Since for very big working copies
					this can take a while, you can set this value to <literal>false</literal>
					to deactivate this feature.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>FullRowSelect</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The status list control which is used in various dialogs
					(e.g., commit, check-for-modifications, add, revert, ...)
					uses full row selection (i.e., if you select an entry, the
					full row is selected, not just the first column).
					This is fine, but the selected row then also covers the
					background image on the bottom right, which can look ugly.
					To disable full row select, set this value to 
					<literal>false</literal>.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>StyleCommitMessages</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The commit and log dialog style commit messages (see
					<xref linkend="tsvn-dug-commit-log"/> for details). If you
					don't want to do this, set this value to 
					<literal>false</literal>.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>ShellMenuAccelerators</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					TortoiseSVN uses accelerators for its explorer context menu
					entries. Since this can lead to doubled accelerators (e.g.
					the <literal>SVN Commit</literal> has the <keycap>Alt-C</keycap>
					accelerator, but so does the <literal>Copy</literal> entry
					of explorer).
					If you don't want or need the accelerators of the TortoiseSVN
					entries, set this value to <literal>false</literal>.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>AlwaysExtendedMenu</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					As the explorer, TortoiseSVN also shows additional commands
					if the <keycap>Shift<keycap> key is pressed while the
					context menu is opened.
					To force TortoiseSVN to always show those extended commands,
					set this value to <literal>true</literal>.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>BlockStatus</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					If you don't want the explorer to update the status overlays 
					while another TortoiseSVN command is running 
					(e.g. Update, Commit, ...) then set this value to
					<literal>true</literal>.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>UpdateCheckURL</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					This value contains the URL from which TortoiseSVN tries 
					to download a text file to find out if there are updates 
					available. 
					This might be useful for company admins who don't want 
					their users to update TortoiseSVN until they approve it.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>ColumnsEveryWhere</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The extra columns the TortoiseSVN adds to the details view
					in Windows Explorer (Only XP, Vista and later don't support
					that feature anymore) are normally only active in a working
					copy. If you want those to be accessible everywhere, not
					just in working copies, set this value to 
					<literal>true</literal>.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>AllowUnversionedObstruction</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					TortoiseSVN by default allows an update that adds a file
					but which already exists unversioned in the local working 
					copy (i.e., an update adds a file that already exists but
					is not under version control). And differences between the
					newly versioned file and the existing unversioned file
					are then properly handled, i.e. the file appears as 
					modified.
					If you rather want TortoiseSVN to create a conflict in
					such situations, set this value to <literal>false</literal>.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>OldVersionCheck</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					TortoiseSVN checks whether there's a new version available
					about once a week. If an updated version is found, the
					commit dialog shows a link control with that info.
					If you rather want the old behavior back where a dialog
					pops up notifying you about the update, set this value to
					<literal>true</literal>.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>VersionCheck</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					TortoiseSVN checks whether there's a new version available
					about once a week. If you don't want TortoiseSVN to do this
					check, set this value to <literal>false</literal>.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>AutocompleteRemovesExtensions</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The auto-completion list shown in the commit message editor
					displays the names of files listed for commit.
					To also include these names with extensions removed,
					set this value to <literal>true</literal>.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>Merge log separator</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					When you merge revisions from another branch, and merge tracking
					information is available, the log messages from the revisions
					you merge will be collected to make up a commit log message.
					A pre-defined string is used to separate the individual log
					messages of the merged revisions. If you prefer, you can set
					this to a value containing a separator string of your choice.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>DiffBlamesWithTortoiseMerge</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					TortoiseSVN allows you to assign external diff viewer.
					Most such viewers, however, are not suited for change blaming
					(<xref linkend="tsvn-dug-blame-diffs"/>),
					so you might wish to fall back to TortoiseMerge in this case.
					To do so, set this value to <literal>true</literal>.
				</para>
