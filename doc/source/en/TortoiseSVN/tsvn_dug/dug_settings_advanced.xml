    <para>
        A few infrequently used settings are available only in the advanced
        page of the settings dialog. These settings modify the registry directly
        and you have to know what each of these settings is used for and what
        it does. Do not modify these settings unless you are sure you need to
        change them.

                    Sometimes multiple users use the same account on the same computer.
                    In such situations it's not really wanted to save the authentication
                    data. Setting this value to <literal>false</literal> disables the
                    <literal>save authentication</literal> button in the authentication
                    dialog.

                    If an update adds a new file from the repository which
                    already exists in the local working copy as an unversioned
                    file, the default action is to keep the local file, showing
                    it as a (possibly) modified version of the new file from the
                    repository.
                    If you would prefer TortoiseSVN to create a conflict in
                    such situations, set this value to <literal>false</literal>.

                    Note that the extra columns are only available in XP.

                    TortoiseSVN allows you to assign an external diff viewer.

                    (<xref linkend="tsvn-dug-blame-diffs"/>),
                    so you might wish to fall back to TortoiseMerge in this case.

                    Some apps change the case of filenames without notice
                    but those changes aren't really necessary nor wanted.
                    For example a change from <filename>file.txt</filename>
                    to <filename>FILE.TXT</filename> wouldn't bother
                    normal Windows applications, but Subversion is case
                    sensitive in these situations. So TortoiseSVN automatically
                    fixes such case changes.

                    The status list control which is used in various dialogs
                    (e.g., commit, check-for-modifications, add, revert, ...)
                    uses full row selection (i.e., if you select an entry, the
                    full row is selected, not just the first column).
                    This is fine, but the selected row then also covers the
                    background image on the bottom right, which can look ugly.
                    To disable full row select, set this value to

                                then there are two application icon groups shown
                                in the Win7 taskbar, one group for each repository.
                                But TortoiseMerge windows are not grouped together
                                with TortoiseSVN dialogs.

                    By default, TortoiseSVN always runs an update with externals
                    included. This avoids problems with inconsistent working copies.
                    If you have however a lot of externals set, an update can
                    take quite a while. Set this value to <literal>false</literal>
                    to run the default update with externals excluded. To
                    update with externals included, either run the
                    <literal>Update to revision...</literal> dialog or set this
                    value to <literal>true</literal> again.

                    When the log dialog is started from the merge wizard,
                    already merged revisions are shown in gray, but revisions
                    beyond the point where the branch was created are also shown.
                    These revisions are shown in black because those can't be
                    merged.

                    If this option is set to <literal>true</literal> then TortoiseSVN

                    and hide all the revisions that are beyond that revision.
                    Since this can take quite a while, this option is disabled
                    by default. Also this option doesn't work with some SVN servers
                    (e.g., Google Code Hosting, see

                    The log dialog shows the revision the working copy path

                    the status of that path. Since for very big working copies
                    this can take a while, you can set this value to <literal>false</literal>

                    A pre-defined string is used to separate the individual log

                    TortoiseSVN checks whether there's a new version available
                    about once a week. If an updated version is found, the
                    commit dialog shows a link control with that info.
                    If you prefer the old behavior back where a dialog

                    With some graphic cards however this sometimes

                    TortoiseSVN uses accelerators for its explorer context menu
                    entries. Since this can lead to doubled accelerators (e.g.
                    the <literal>SVN Commit</literal> has the <keycap>Alt-C</keycap>
                    accelerator, but so does the <literal>Copy</literal> entry
                    of explorer).
                    If you don't want or need the accelerators of the TortoiseSVN
