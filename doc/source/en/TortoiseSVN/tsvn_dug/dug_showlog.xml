		For every change you make and commit, you should provide
		a log message for that change. That way you can later find out
		what changes you made and why, and you have a detailed log for
		your development process.
	</para>
	<para>
		The Revision Log Dialog retrieves all those log messages and shows them
		to you.
		The display is divided into 3 panes.
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The top pane shows a list of revisions where changes to the
					file/folder have been committed. This summary includes the
					date and time, the person who committed the revision and the
					start of the log message.
				</para>
				<para>
					Lines shown in blue indicate that something has been copied
					to this development line (perhaps from a branch).
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The middle pane shows the full log message for the selected
					revision.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The bottom pane shows a list of all files and folders that
					were changed as part of the selected revision.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		But it does much more than that - it provides context menu
		commands which you can use to get even more information about the
		project history.

				<listitem>
					<para>
						Compare the selected revision with your working copy.
						The default Diff-Tool is TortoiseMerge which
						is supplied with TortoiseSVN.
						If the log dialog is for a folder, this will show you a list
						of changed files, and allow you to review the changes made
						to each file individually.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						View the changes made in the selected revision as a
						Unified-Diff file (GNU patch format). This shows

						show all file changes together in a compact format.
					</para>

				<listitem>
					<para>
						Save the selected revision to a file so you have an older
						version of that file. This option is only available when
						you access the log for a file, and it saves a version of
						that one file only.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>

						Open the selected file, either with the default viewer for

					<para>
						Open the repository browser to examine the selected folder.

				<listitem>
					<para>
						Create a branch/tag from a selected revision.
						This is useful e.g. if you forgot to create a tag and already
						committed some changes which weren't supposed to get into
						that release.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Update your working copy to the selected
						revision. Useful if you want to have your working copy reflect
						a time in the past. It is best to update a whole directory
						in your working copy, not just one file, otherwise your
						working copy will be inconsistent and you will be unable to
						commit any changes.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Revert changes from which were made in the selected
						revision. The changes are reverted in your working copy so
						this operation does <emphasis>not</emphasis> affect the
						repository at all! Note that this will undo the changes
						made in that revision only. It does not replace your
						working copy with the entire file at the earlier revision.
						This is very useful for undoing an earlier change when
						other unrelated changes have been made since.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Revert to an earlier revision. If you have made several
						changes, and then decide that you really want to go back to
						how things were in revision N, this is the command you need.
						Again, the changes are reverted in your working copy so
						this operation does <emphasis>not</emphasis> affect the
						repository until you commit the changes. Note that this
						will undo <emphasis>all</emphasis> changes made after the
						selected revision, replacing the file/folder with the
						earlier version.

			The Log dialog does not always show all changes ever made for a

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						For a large repository there may be hundreds or even
						thousands of changes and fetching them all could take

						When the <guilabel>Stop on copy/rename</guilabel>
						box is checked, Show Log will stop at the point that
						the selected file or folder was copied from somewhere
						else within the repository. This can be useful when
						looking at branches (or tags) as it stops at the root
						of that branch, and gives a quick indication of changes
						made in that branch only.
					</para>
					<para>
						Normally you will want to leave this option unchecked.
						TortoiseSVN remembers the state of the checkbox, so

					</para>
					<para>
						When the Show Log dialog is invoked from within the
						Merge dialog, the box is always checked by default.
						This is because merging is most often looking at
						changes on branches, and going back beyond the root
						of the branch does not make sense in that instance.
					</para>

						Note that Subversion currently implements renaming
						as a copy/delete pair, so renaming a file or folder
						will also cause the log display to stop if this

            in that folder or below it. For a file it means just that one file.
