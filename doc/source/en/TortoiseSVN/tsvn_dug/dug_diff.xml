        One of the commonest requirements in project development is to
        see what has changed. You might want to look at the differences
        between two revisions of the same file, or the differences between
        two separate files.
        TortoiseSVN provides a built-in tool named
        <application>TortoiseMerge</application> for viewing differences of
        text files. For viewing differences of image files, TortoiseSVN
        also has a tool named <application>TortoiseIDiff</application>.
        Of course, you can use your own favourite diff program if you
        like.

                        If you want to see what has changed on trunk (if you are
                        working on a branch) or on a specific branch (if you are
                        working on trunk), you can use the explorer context menu.
                        Just hold down the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key while you
                        right click on the file. Then select

                        The context menu there allows you to compare them

                        hasn't been modified, just right click on the file. Then select

                        to bring it to the state you now see in your working copy.
                        It will not show changes newer than your working copy.

                        as it shows a patch file - a list of changed files which

            Sometimes in the life of a project you might change the line endings

            change the indentation of a section. Unfortunately this will mark
            a large number of lines as changed, even though there is no change

            If the list of filenames is very long, you can use the search box
            to reduce the list to filenames containing specific text. Note that
            a simple text search is used, so if you want to restrict the list
            to C source files you should enter <filename>.c</filename> rather than
            <filename>*.c</filename>.

            There are many tools available for diffing text files, including our
            own TortoiseMerge, but we often find ourselves wanting to see how
            an image file has changed too. That's why we created TortoiseIDiff.

            for any of the common image file formats will start TortoiseIDiff
            to show image differences. By default the images are displayed side-by-side
            but you can use the View menu or toolbar to switch to a top-bottom
            view instead, or if you prefer, you can overlay the images and pretend
            you are using a lightbox.
        </para>
        <para>
            Naturally you can also zoom in and out and pan around the image.
            You can also pan the image simply by left-dragging it.
            If you select the <guilabel>Link images together</guilabel> option,
            then the pan controls (scrollbars, mousewheel) on both images are linked.
        </para>
        <para>
            An image info box shows details about the image file, such as the
            size in pixels, resolution and colour depth. If this box gets in the
            way, use
            <menuchoice>
                <guimenu>View</guimenu>
                <guimenuitem>Image Info</guimenuitem>
            </menuchoice>
            to hide it.
            You can get the same information in a tooltip if you hover the mouse
            over the image title bar.
        </para>
        <para>
            When the images are overlaid, the relative intensity of the images
            (alpha blend) is controlled by a slider control at the left side.
            You can click anywhere in the slider to set the blend directly, or you
            can drag the slider to change the blend interactively.
            <keycap>Ctrl+Shift</keycap>-<action>Wheel</action> to change the blend.
        </para>
        <para>
            The button above the slider toggles between 0% and 100% blends, and
            if you double click the button, the blend toggles automatically every
            second until you click the button again. This can be useful when looking
            for multiple small changes.
        </para>
        <para>
            Sometimes you want to see a difference rather than a blend. You might
            have the image files for two revisions of a printed circuit board and
            want to see which tracks have changed. If you disable alpha blend mode,
            the difference will be shown as an <emphasis>XOR</emphasis> of the pixel
            colour values. Unchanged areas will be plain white and changes will be
            coloured.

            When you want to diff non-text documents you normally have to use the
            software used to create the document as it understands the file format.
            For the commonly used Microsoft Office and Open Office suites there
            is indeed some support for viewing differences and TortoiseSVN
            includes scripts to invoke these with the right settings when you
            diff files with the well-known file extensions. You can check which
            file extensions are supported and add your own by going to

                If you installed the <emphasis>Click-to-Run</emphasis> version of
                Office 2010 and you try to diff documents you may get an error message
                from Windows Script Host something like this:
                <quote>ActiveX component can't create object: word.Application</quote>.
                It seems you have to use the MSI-based version of Office to get
                the diff functionality.

                        ExamDiff Standard is freeware. It can handle
                        files but not directories.
                        ExamDiff Pro is shareware and adds a number
                        of goodies including directory diff and editing
                        capability.
                        In both flavours, version 3.2 and above can handle
