        This dialog allows you to configure the log caching feature of
        TortoiseSVN, which retains a local copy of log messages and changed
        paths to avoid time-consuming downloads from the server. Using the
        log cache can dramatically speed up the log dialog and the revision graph.
        Another useful feature is that the log messages can still be
        accessed when offline.

                        Enables log caching whenever log data is requested.
                        If checked, data will be retrieved from the cache when
                        available, and any messages not in the cache will be retrieved
                        from the server and added to the cache.

                        If caching is disabled, data will always be retrieved
                        directly from the server and not stored locally.

                        Occasionally you may have to connect to a server which uses
                        the same URL for all repositories. Older versions of
                        <literal>svnbridge</literal> would do this. If you need to
                        access such repositories you will have to check this option.
                        If you don't, leave it unchecked to improve performance.

                    <para>
                        Some hosting services give all their repositories the same
                        UUID. You may even have done this yourself by copying a
                        repository folder to create a new one. For all sorts of
                        reasons this is a bad idea - a UUID should be
                        <emphasis>unique</emphasis>. However, the log cache will
                        still work in this situation if you check this box.
                        If you don't need it, leave it unchecked to improve performance.

                        If you are working offline, or if the repository server
                        is down, the log cache can still be used to supply log
                        messages already held in the cache. Of course the cache
                        may not be up-to-date, so there are options to allow you
                        to select whether this feature should be used.

                        When log data is being taken from the cache without contacting
                        the server, the dialog using those message will show the offline
                        state in its title bar.

                    <para>
                        When you invoke the log dialog you will normally want to
                        contact the server to check for any newer log messages.
                        If the timeout set here is non-zero then the server will
                        only be contacted when the timeout has elapsed since the
                        last time contact. This can reduce server round-trips
                        if you open the log dialog frequently and the server is
                        slow, but the data shown may not be completely up-to-date.
                        If you want to use this feature we suggest using a value
                        of 300 (5 minutes) as a compromise.

                    <para>
                        If you browse around a lot of repositories you will
                        accumulate a lot of log caches. If you're not actively
                        using them, the cache will not grow very big, so
                        TortoiseSVN purges them after a set time by default.
                        Use this item to control cache purging.

                        Larger caches are more expensive to reacquire, so
                        TortoiseSVN only purges small caches. Fine tune the
                        threshold with this value.

                        Occasionally something goes wrong with the caching and
                        causes a crash. If this happens the cache is normally
                        deleted automatically to prevent a recurrence of the problem.
                        If you use the less stable nightly build you may opt to
                        keep the cache anyway.

            On this page you can see a list of the repositories that are
            cached locally, and the space used for the cache. If you select one
            of the repositories you can then use the buttons underneath.

            Click on the <guibutton>Update</guibutton> to completely refresh the
            cache and fill in any holes. For a large repository this could be
            very time consuming, but useful if you are about to go offline
            and want the best available cache.

        <para>
            Click on the <guibutton>Export</guibutton> button to export the entire
            cache as a set of CSV files. This could be useful if you want to process
            the log data using an external program, although it is mainly useful to
            the developers.

        <para>
            Click on <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> to remove all cached data for
            the selected repositories. This does not disable caching for the repository
            so the next time you request log data, a new cache will be created.
