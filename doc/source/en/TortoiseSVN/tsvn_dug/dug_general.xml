        <para>
            This section describes some of the features of TortoiseSVN which apply
            to just about everything in the manual. Note that many of these features
            will only show up within a Subversion working copy.

            One of the most visible features of TortoiseSVN is the icon
            overlays which appear on files in your working copy. These
            show you at a glance which of your files have been modified.
            Refer to <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-wcstatus-1"/> to find out
            what the different overlays represent.

                <graphic fileref="../images/ContextMenuDirControl.png"/>
            </figure>
            All TortoiseSVN commands are invoked from the context menu of the windows
            explorer. Most are directly visible, when you <action>right click</action>
            on a file or folder. The commands that are available depend on whether the
            file or folder or its parent folder is under version control or not.
            You can also see the TortoiseSVN menu as part of the Explorer file menu.
        </para>
        <tip>
            <para>
                Some commands which are very rarely used are only available in the
                extended context menu. To bring up the extended context menu, hold
                down the <keycap>Shift</keycap> key when you <action>right click</action>.
            </para>
        </tip>
        <para>
            In some cases you may see several TortoiseSVN entries. This is not a bug!
            <figure id="tsvn-dug-explorer-file-menu">
                <title>Explorer file menu for a shortcut in a versioned folder</title>
                <graphic fileref="../images/ExplorerFileMenuFileShortcut.png"/>
            </figure>
            This example is for an unversioned shortcut within a versioned folder, and
            in the Explorer file menu there are <emphasis>three</emphasis> entries
            for TortoiseSVN. One is for the folder, one for the shortcut itself,
            and the third for the object the shortcut is pointing to.
            To help you distinguish between them, the icons have an indicator in the
            lower right corner to show whether the menu entry is for a file,
            a folder, a shortcut or for multiple selected items.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you are using Windows 2000 you will find that the context menus are
            shown as plain text, without the menu icons shown above. We are aware that
            this was working in previous versions, but Microsoft has changed the way
            its icon handlers work for Vista, requiring us to use a different display
            method which unfortunately does not work on Windows 2000.

            Some common operations have well-known Windows shortcuts, but do
            not appear on buttons or in menus. If you can't work out how
            to do something obvious, like refreshing a view, check here.

                            In Explorer this will refresh the icon overlays on your working copy.
                            In the commit dialog it will re-scan the working copy
                            to see what may need to be committed.
                            In the Revision Log dialog it will contact the repository
                            again to check for more recent changes.

            Enter your username and password. The checkbox will make TortoiseSVN
            store the credentials in Subversion's default directory:

                        for basic authentication (username/password).
                        Note that passwords are stored using the WinCrypt API,
                        not in plain text form.

            If you want to clear the authentication cache for all
            servers, you can do so from the <guilabel>Saved Data</guilabel> page
            of TortoiseSVN's settings dialog. That button will clear all cached
            authentication data from the Subversion <filename>auth</filename>
            directories, as well as any authentication
            data stored in the registry by earlier versions of TortoiseSVN.
            Refer to <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-settings-saved-data"/>.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you want to clear authentication for one realm only then you will
            have to dig into those directories, find the file which contains the
            information you want to clear and delete the file.
        </para>
        <para>
            Some people like to have the authentication data deleted when they
            log off Windows, or on shutdown. The way to do that is to use a shutdown
            script to delete the <filename>%APPDATA%\Subversion\auth</filename>
            directory, e.g.
<screen>
@echo off
rmdir /s /q "%APPDATA%\Subversion\auth"
</screen>
            You can find a description of how to install such scripts at
            <ulink url="http://www.windows-help-central.com/windows-shutdown-script.html">

        <para>
            Many of TortoiseSVN's dialogs have a lot of information to display,
            but it is often useful to maximize only the height, or only the width,
            rather than maximizing to fill the screen. As a convenience, there are
            shortcuts for this on the <guilabel>Maximize</guilabel> button.
            Use the <action>middle mouse</action> button to maximize vertically,
            and <action>right mouse</action> to maximize horizontally.
