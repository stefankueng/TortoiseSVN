        If you want to undo all changes you made in a file since
        the last update you need to select the file,
        <action>right click</action> to pop up the context menu and then select
        the command
        <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Revert</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        A dialog will pop up showing you the files that you've changed and
        can revert. Select those you want to revert and click on
        <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.

        If you also want to clear all the changelists that are set, check the box
        at the bottom of the dialog.

    <para>
        If you want to undo a deletion or a rename, you need to use
        Revert on the parent folder as the deleted item does not
        exist for you to right click on.
    </para>
    <para>
        If you want to undo the addition of an item, this appears in
        the context menu as
        <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Undo add...</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>.
        This is really a revert as well, but the name has been changed
        to make it more obvious.
    </para>
    <para>
        The columns in this dialog can be customized in the same way as the
        columns in the <guilabel>Check for modifications</guilabel> dialog.

    <para>
        Since revert is sometimes used to clean up a working copy, there is an
        extra button which allows you to delete unversioned items as well.
        When you click this button another dialog comes up listing all the
        unversioned items, which you can then select for deletion.

        <para>
            When you revert changes you may find that the operation takes a lot
            longer than you expect. This is because the modified version of the
            file is sent to the recycle bin, so you can retrieve your changes
            if you reverted by mistake. However, if your recycle bin is full,
            Windows takes a long time to find a place to put the file. The
            solution is simple: either empty the recycle bin or deactivate
            the <guilabel>Use recycle bin when reverting</guilabel> box
            in TortoiseSVN's settings.
