        If your repository has for some reason changed it's
        location (IP/URL). Maybe you're even stuck and can't
        commit and you don't want to checkout your working
        copy again from the new location and to move all your
        changed data back into the new working copy,
        <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Relocate</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        is the command you are looking for. It basically
        does very little: it rewrites all URLs that are associated with each
        file and folder with the new URL.
    </para>
    <note>
        <para>
        This operation only works on working copy <emphasis>roots</emphasis>.
        So the context menu entry is only shown for working copy roots.
        </para>
    </note>
    <para>
        You may be surprised to find that TortoiseSVN contacts the repository
        as part of this operation. All it is doing is performing some simple
        checks to make sure that the new URL really does refer to the same
        repository as the existing working copy.
    </para>
    <warning>
        <para>
            <emphasis>This is a very infrequently used operation</emphasis>.
            The relocate command is <emphasis>only</emphasis> used if the URL of the
            repository root has changed. Possible reasons are:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The IP address of the server has changed.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The protocol has changed (e.g. http:// to https://).</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The repository root path in the server setup has changed.</para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            Put another way, you need to relocate when your working copy is referring
            to the same location in the same repository, but the repository itself
            has moved.
        </para>
        <para>
            It does not apply if:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        You want to move to a different Subversion repository. In that case
                        you should perform a clean checkout from the new repository location.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        You want to switch to a different branch or directory within the
                        same repository. To do that you should use
                        <menuchoice>
                            <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
                            <guimenuitem>Switch...</guimenuitem>
                        </menuchoice>.

                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>
            If you use relocate in either of the cases above, it
            <emphasis>will corrupt your working copy</emphasis> and you will get many
            unexplainable error messages while updating, committing, etc.
            Once that has happened, the only fix is a fresh checkout.
        </para>
