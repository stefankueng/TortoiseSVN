        Sometimes you need to know not only what lines have changed, but also
        who exactly changed specific lines in a file. That's when the
        <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Blame...</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        command, sometimes also referred to as <firstterm>annotate</firstterm>
        command comes in handy.
    </para>
    <para>
        This command lists, for every line in a file, the author and the revision
        the line was changed.

            </figure>
            If you're not interested in changes from earlier revisions you can
            set the revision from which the blame should start. Set this to <literal>1</literal>,
            if you want the blame for <emphasis>every</emphasis> revision.

        <para>
            By default the blame file is viewed using <firstterm>TortoiseBlame</firstterm>,
            which highlights the different revisions to make it easier to read.
            If you wish to print or edit the blame file, select
            <guilabel>Use Text viewer to view blames</guilabel>.

            You can specify the way that line ending and whitespace changes are handled.
            These options are described in <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-diff-eol-whitespace"/>.
            The default behaviour is to treat all whitespace and line-end differences
            as real changes, but if you want to ignore an indentation change and find
            the original author, you can choose an appropriate option here.
        </para>
        <para>
            You can include merge information as well if you wish, although this option
            can take considerably longer to retrieve from the server. When lines are merged
            from another source, the blame information shows the revision the change
            was made in the original source as well as the revision when it was merged
            into this file.

            Once you press <guibutton>OK</guibutton> TortoiseSVN starts retrieving
            the data to create the blame file. Please note: This can take several
            minutes to finish, depending on how much the file has changed and
            of course your network connection to the repository. Once the blame
            process has finished the result is written into a temporary file and
            you can view the results.

            TortoiseBlame, which is included with TortoiseSVN, makes the blame file
            easier to read. When you hover the mouse over a line in the blame info
            column, all lines with the same revision are shown with a darker
            background. Lines from other revisions which were changed by the same author
            are shown with a light background.
            The colouring may not work as clearly if you have your display set to
            256 colour mode.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you <action>left click</action>
            on a line, all lines with the same revision are highlighted, and lines from
            other revisions by the same author are highlighted in a lighter colour.
            This highlighting is sticky, allowing you to move the mouse without losing
            the highlights. Click on that revision again to turn off highlighting.
        </para>
        <para>
            The revision comments (log message) are shown in a hint box whenever
            the mouse hovers over the blame info column. If you want to copy the
            log message for that revision, use the context menu which appears when
            you right click on the blame info column.
        </para>
        <para>
            You can search within the Blame report using
            <menuchoice>
                <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>
                <guimenuitem>Find...</guimenuitem>
            </menuchoice>.
            This allows you to search for revision numbers, authors and the content of
            the file itself. Log messages are not included in the search - you should
            use the Log Dialog to search those.
        </para>
        <para>
            You can also jump to a specific line number using
            <menuchoice>
                <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>
                <guimenuitem>Go To Line...</guimenuitem>
            </menuchoice>.
        </para>
        <para>
            When the mouse is over the blame info columns, a context menu is
            available which helps with comparing revisions and examining history,
            using the revision number of the line under the mouse as a reference.
            <menuchoice>
                <guimenu>Context menu</guimenu>
                <guimenuitem>Blame previous revision</guimenuitem>
            </menuchoice> generates a blame report for the same file, but using
            the previous revision as the upper limit. This gives you the blame
            report for the state of the file just before the line you are looking
            at was last changed.
            <menuchoice>
                <guimenu>Context menu</guimenu>
                <guimenuitem>Show changes</guimenuitem>
            </menuchoice> starts your diff viewer, showing you what changed in
            the referenced revision.
            <menuchoice>
                <guimenu>Context menu</guimenu>
                <guimenuitem>Show log</guimenuitem>
            </menuchoice> displays the revision log dialog starting with the
            referenced revision.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you need a better visual indicator of where the oldest and newest
            changes are, select
            <menuchoice>
                <guimenu>View</guimenu>
                <guimenuitem>Color age of lines</guimenuitem>
            </menuchoice>.
            This will use a colour gradient to show newer lines in red and older lines
            in blue. The default colouring is quite light, but you can change it using
            the TortoiseBlame settings.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you are using Merge Tracking and you requested merge info when starting the blame,
            merged lines are shown slightly differently. Where a line has changed as a result of
            merging from another path, TortoiseBlame will show the revision and author
            of the last change in the original file rather than the revision where the
            merge took place. These lines are indicated by showing the revision and
            author in italics.
            The revision where the merge took place is shown separately in the tooltip
            when you hover the mouse over the blame info columns.
            If you do not want merged lines shown in this way, uncheck the
            <guilabel>Include merge info</guilabel> checkbox when starting the blame.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you want to see the paths involved in the merge, select
            <menuchoice>
                <guimenu>View</guimenu>
                <guimenuitem>Merge paths</guimenuitem>
            </menuchoice>.
            This shows the path where the line was last changed, excluding changes resulting
            from a merge.
        </para>
        <para>
            The revision shown in the blame information represents the last revision where the
            content of that line changed. If the file was created by copying another file, then
            until you change a line, its blame revision will show the last change in the original
            source file, not the revision where the copy was made. This also applies to the
            paths shown with merge info. The path shows the repository location where the last
            change was made to that line.

        <para>
            One of the limitations of the Blame report is that it only shows the file as
            it was in a particular revision, and the last person to change each line.
            Sometimes you want to know what change was made, as well as who made it.
            If you right click on a line in TortoiseBlame you have a context menu item
            to show the changes made in that revision. But if you want to see the changes
            <emphasis>and</emphasis> the blame information simultaneously then you need a
            combination of the diff and blame reports.
