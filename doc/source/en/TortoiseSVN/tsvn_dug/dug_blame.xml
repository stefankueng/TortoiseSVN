		Sometimes you need to know not only what lines have changed, but also
		who exactly changed specific lines in a file. That's when the
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Blame...</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		command, sometimes also referred to as <firstterm>annotate</firstterm>
		command comes in handy.
	</para>
	<para>
		This command lists, for every line in a file, the author and the revision
		the line was changed.

			If you're not interested in changes from earlier revisions you can

			By default the blame file is viewed using <firstterm>TortoiseBlame</firstterm>,

			Once you press <guibutton>OK</guibutton> TortoiseSVN starts retrieving
			the data to create the blame file. Please note: This can take several
			minutes to finish, depending on how much the file has changed and
			of course your network connection to the repository. Once the blame
			process has finished the result is written into a temporary file and
			you can view the results.

			TortoiseBlame, which is included with TortoiseSVN, makes the blame file
			easier to read. When you hover the mouse over a line in the blame info
			column, all lines with the same revision are shown with a darker
			background. Lines from other revisions which were changed by the same author
			are shown with a light background.
			The colouring may not work as clearly if you have your display set to
			256 colour mode.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you <action>left click</action>
			on a line, all lines with the same revision are highlighted, and lines from
			other revisions by the same author are highlighted in a lighter colour.
			This highlighting is sticky, allowing you to move the mouse without losing
			the highlights. Click on that revision again to turn off highlighting.
		</para>
		<para>
			The revision comments (log message) are shown in a hint box whenever
			the mouse hovers over the blame info column. If you want to copy the
			log message for that revision, use the context menu which appears when
			you right click on the blame info column.
		</para>
		<para>
			You can search within the Blame report using
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Edit</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Find...</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>.
			This allows you to search for revision numbers, authors and the content of
			the file itself. Log messages are not included in the search - you should
			use the Log Dialog to search those.
		</para>
		<para>
			You can also jump to a specific line number using
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Edit</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Go To Line...</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>.
		</para>
		<para>
			When the mouse is over the blame info columns, a context menu is
			available which helps with comparing revisions and examining history,
			using the revision number of the line under the mouse as a reference.
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Context menu</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Blame previous revision</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice> generates a blame report for the same file, but using
			the previous revision as the upper limit. This gives you the blame
			report for the state of the file just before the line you are looking
			at was last changed.
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Context menu</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Show differences</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice> starts your diff viewer, showing you what changed in
			the referenced revision.
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Context menu</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Show log</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice> displays the revision log dialog starting with the
			referenced revision.
		</para>
		<para>
			Although TortoiseBlame has no settings dialog of its own, it uses the same
			font as TortoiseMerge, so if you want to change it, start TortoiseMerge
			and use the settings dialog there.

			One of the limitations of the Blame report is that it only shows the file as
			it was in a particular revision, and shows the last person to change each line.
			Sometimes you want to know what change was made, as well as who made it. What
			you need here is a combination of the diff and blame reports.
		</para>

			The revision log dialog includes several options which allow you to do this.
