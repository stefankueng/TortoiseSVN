            To easily select only the items you want for the checkout and force
            the resulting working copy to keep only those items, click the
            <guibutton>Choose items...</guibutton> button. This opens a new dialog
            where you can check all items you want in your working copy and uncheck
            all the items you don't want. The resulting working copy is then known
            as a <literal>sparse checkout</literal>. An update of such a working
            copy will not fetch the missing files and folders but only update
            what you already have in your working copy.

            If you check out a sparse working copy (i.e., by choosing something other
            than <literal>fully recursive</literal> for the checkout depth), you can
            easily add or remove sub-folders later using one of the following methods.

                This opens the same dialog that was available in the original checkout
                and allows you to select or deselect items to include in the checkout.
                This method is very flexible but can be slow as every item in the folder
                is updated individually.

            This feature is very useful when you only want to checkout parts of a
            large tree, but you want the convenience of updating a single working
            copy. Suppose you have a large tree which has sub-folders
            <literal>Project01</literal> to <literal>Project99</literal>,
            and you only want to checkout
            <literal>Project03</literal>,
            <literal>Project25</literal> and

            <para>
                Once you have checked out a working copy to a particular
                depth you can change that depth later to get more or less

            <para>
                Pre-1.5 servers do not understand the working copy depth
                request, so they cannot always deal with requests efficiently.
                The command will still work, but an older server may send all
                the data, leaving the client to filter out what is not required,
                which may mean a lot of network traffic. If possible you should
                upgrade your server to at least 1.5.

        If the project contains references to external projects which you do

    </para>
    <important>
        <para>
            If <guilabel>Omit externals</guilabel> is checked, or if you wish
            to increase the depth value, you will have to perform
            updates to your working copy using
            <menuchoice>
                <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
                <guimenuitem>Update to Revision...</guimenuitem>

                <guimenuitem>Update</guimenuitem>
            </menuchoice>.
            The standard update will include all externals and keep the existing depth.

        It is recommended that you check out only the <literal>trunk</literal> part of the
        directory tree, or lower. If you specify the parent path of the
        directory tree in the URL then you might end up with a full
        hard disk since you will get a copy of the entire repository tree
        including every branch and tag of your project!
