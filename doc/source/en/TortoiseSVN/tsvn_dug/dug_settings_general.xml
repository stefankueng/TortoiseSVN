                    TortoiseSVN will contact its download site periodically
                    to see if there is a newer version of the program available.
                    If there is it will show a notification link in the commit dialog.
                    Use <guibutton>Check now</guibutton> if you want an answer
                    right away. The new version will not be downloaded; you
                    simply receive an information dialog telling you that the
                    new version is available.

                    Global ignore patterns are used to prevent unversioned files from
                    showing up e.g. in the commit dialog. Files matching the
                    patterns are also ignored by an import.
                    Ignore files or directories by typing in the names or extensions.
                    Patterns are separated by spaces e.g.
                    <literal>bin obj *.bak *.~?? *.jar *.[Tt]mp</literal>.
                    These patterns should not include any path separators. Note also
                    that there is no way to differentiate between files and directories.
                    Read <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-ignore-glob"/> for more information
                    on the pattern-matching syntax.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Note that the ignore patterns you specify here will also
                    affect other Subversion clients running on your PC, including
                    the command line client.

                    If you use the Subversion configuration file to set
                    a <literal>global-ignores</literal> pattern, it will
                    override the settings you make here. The Subversion
                    configuration file is accessed using the
                    <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> as described below.

                <para>
                    This ignore pattern will affect all your projects.
                    It is not versioned, so it will not affect other users.
                    By contrast you can also use the versioned
                    <literal>svn:ignore</literal> or <literal>svn:global-ignores</literal>
                    property to exclude files or directories from version control. Read
                    <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-ignore"/>

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    This option tells TortoiseSVN to set the file dates to
                    the last commit time when doing a checkout or an update.
                    Otherwise TortoiseSVN will use the current date.
                    If you are developing software it is generally best
                    to use the current date because build systems normally
                    look at the date stamps to decide which files need
                    compiling. If you use <quote>last commit time</quote> and revert
                    to an older file revision, your project may not compile
                    as you expect it to.

                    Some settings cannot be modified directly by

                    Note that Subversion can read configuration information
                    from several places, and you need to know which one
                    takes priority. Refer to

            This page allows you to specify which of the TortoiseSVN context menu
            entries will show up in the main context menu, and which will appear

            There is a special case for <guilabel>Get Lock</guilabel>. You can of
            course promote it to the top level using the list above, but as most
            files don't need locking this just adds clutter. However, a file with
            the <literal>svn:needs-lock</literal> property needs this action every
            time it is edited, so in that case it is very useful to have at the top
            level. Checking the box here means that when a file is selected which has
            the <literal>svn:needs-lock</literal> property set,
            <guilabel>Get Lock</guilabel> will always appear at the top level.

        <para>
            Most of the time, you won't need the TortoiseSVN context menu, apart
            for folders that are under version control by Subversion. For non-
            versioned folders, you only really need the context menu when you
            want to do a checkout. If you check the option <literal>Hide menus
            for unversioned paths</literal>, TortoiseSVN will not add its entries
            to the context menu for unversioned folders. But the entries are
            added for all items and paths in a versioned folder. And you can
            get the entries back for unversioned folders by holding the
            <keycap>Shift</keycap> key down while showing the context menu.

                        always closes the dialog even if there were conflicts.
                        The only condition that keeps the dialog open is an
                        error condition, which occurs when Subversion is unable
                        to complete the task. For example, an update fails
                        because the server is inaccessible, or a commit fails
                        because the working copy is out-of-date.

                        Local operations like adding files or reverting changes do not
                        need to contact the repository and complete quickly, so the
                        progress dialog is often of little interest. Select this option
                        if you want the progress dialog to close automatically after these
                        operations, unless there are errors.

                        When you revert local modifications, your changes are
                        discarded. TortoiseSVN gives you an extra safety net by
                        sending the modified file to the recycle bin before
                        bringing back the pristine copy. If you prefer to
                        skip the recycle bin, uncheck this option.

                        merges. However, some people like to perform merges from
                        many different points in their hierarchy, and find it easier
                        to start out with the URL of the current working copy.
                        This can then be edited to refer to a parallel path on
                        another branch.

                        to the end.

                        The commit dialog includes a facility to parse the list

                        letters of an item in the list, the auto-completion
                        box pops up, and you can press Enter to complete the
                        filename. Check the box to enable this feature.

                        that number here.
                        If you have many different repositories, you may wish to
