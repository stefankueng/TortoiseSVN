        In most projects you will have files and folders that should not be subject
        to version control. These might include files created by the compiler,
        <filename>*.obj, *.lst</filename>, maybe an output folder used to store
        the executable. Whenever you commit changes, TortoiseSVN shows your unversioned
        files, which fills up the file list in the commit dialog. Of course you
        can turn off this display, but then you might forget to add a new source
        file.
    </para>
    <para>
        The best way to avoid these problems is to add the derived files
        to the project's ignore list. That way they will never show up in
        the commit dialog, but genuine unversioned source files will still
        be flagged up.
    </para>
    <para>
        If you <action>right click</action> on a single unversioned file,
        and select the command
        <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Add to Ignore List</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        from the context menu, a submenu appears allowing you to select just that
        file, or all files with the same extension. Both submenus
        also have a <literal>(recursively)</literal> equivalent.
        If you select multiple files, there is no submenu and you can only add
        those specific files/folders.
    </para>
    <para>
        If you choose the <literal>(recursively)</literal> version of
        the ignore context menu, the item will be ignored not just
        for the selected folder but all subfolders as well. However
        this requires SVN clients version 1.8 or higher.
    </para>
    <para>
        If you want to remove one or more items from the ignore list,
        <action>right click</action> on those items and select
        <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
            <guimenuitem>Remove from Ignore List</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>
        You can also access a folder's <literal>svn:ignore</literal>
        property directly. That allows you to specify more general
        patterns using filename globbing, described in the section below.
        Read <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-propertypage"/> for more information
        on setting properties directly. Please be aware that each ignore pattern
        has to be placed on a separate line. Separating them by spaces does not work.

        <title>The Global Ignore List</title>
        <para>
            Another way to ignore files is to add them to the
            <firstterm>global ignore list</firstterm>. The big difference here
            is that the global ignore list is a client property.
            It applies to <emphasis>all</emphasis> Subversion projects, but on
            the client PC only. In general it is better to use the
            <filename>svn:ignore</filename> property where possible, because it
            can be applied to specific project areas, and it works for
            everyone who checks out the project. Read
            <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-settings-main"/> for more information.

        <para>
            Versioned files and folders can never be ignored - that's a feature
            of Subversion. If you versioned a file by mistake, read

            <quote>unversion</quote> it.

            Subversion's ignore patterns make use of filename globbing,
            a technique originally used in Unix to specify files using
            meta-characters as wildcards. The following characters have
            special meaning:
            <variablelist>
                <varlistentry>
                    <term>*</term>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Matches any string of characters, including
                            the empty string (no characters).
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                </varlistentry>
                <varlistentry>
                    <term>?</term>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Matches any single character.
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                </varlistentry>
                <varlistentry>
                    <term>[...]</term>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Matches any one of the characters enclosed in the
                            square brackets. Within the brackets, a pair of
                            characters separated by <quote>-</quote>
                            matches any character lexically between the two.
                            For example <literal>[AGm-p]</literal> matches
                            any one of <literal>A</literal>, <literal>G</literal>,
                            <literal>m</literal>, <literal>n</literal>,
                            <literal>o</literal> or <literal>p</literal>.
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                </varlistentry>
            </variablelist>
        </para>

            Pattern matching is case sensitive, which can cause problems
            on Windows. You can force case insensitivity the hard way
            by pairing characters, e.g. to ignore <literal>*.tmp</literal>
            regardless of case, you could use a pattern like
            <literal>*.[Tt][Mm][Pp]</literal>.

            <title>No Paths in Global Ignore List</title>
            <para>
                You should not include path information in your pattern.
                The pattern matching is intended to be used against plain
                file names and folder names.
                If you want to ignore all <literal>CVS</literal> folders,
                just add <literal>CVS</literal> to the ignore list. There is
                no need to specify <literal>CVS */CVS</literal> as you did in
                earlier versions.
                If you want to ignore all <literal>tmp</literal> folders
                when they exist within a <literal>prog</literal> folder but
                not within a <literal>doc</literal> folder you should use the
                <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property instead. There is no
                reliable way to achieve this using global ignore patterns.
