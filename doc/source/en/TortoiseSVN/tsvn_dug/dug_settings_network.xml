        Here you can configure your proxy server, if you need one to get
        through your company's firewall.

    <para>
        If you need to set up per-repository proxy settings, you will
        need to use the Subversion <filename>servers</filename> file to
        configure this. Use <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> to get there
        directly. Consult the
        <ulink url="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.advanced.confarea.html">
            <citetitle>Runtime Configuration Area</citetitle>
        </ulink>
        for details on how to use this file.

        You can also specify which program TortoiseSVN should use to
        establish a secure connection to a svn+ssh repository.
        We recommend that you use TortoisePlink.exe. This is a version
        of the popular Plink program, and is included with TortoiseSVN,
        but it is compiled as a Windowless app, so you don't get a DOS
        box popping up every time you authenticate.
    </para>
    <para>
        You must specify the full path to the executable. For TortoisePlink.exe
        this is the standard TortoiseSVN bin directory. Use the
        <guibutton>Browse</guibutton> button to help locate it.
        Note that if the path contains spaces, you must enclose it in quotes,
        e.g.
<screen>
"C:\Program Files\TortoiseSVN\bin\TortoisePlink.exe"
</screen>
    </para>
    <para>
        One side-effect of not having a window is that there is
        nowhere for any error messages to go, so if authentication
        fails you will simply get a message saying something like
        <quote>Unable to write to standard output</quote>.
        For this reason we recommend that you first set up using
        standard Plink. When everything is working, you can use
        TortoisePlink with exactly the same parameters.
    </para>
    <para>
        TortoisePlink does not have any documentation of its own because it
        is just a minor variant of Plink. Find out about command line
        parameters from the
        <ulink url="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">
            <citetitle>PuTTY website</citetitle>
        </ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>
        To avoid being prompted for a password repeatedly, you might also
        consider using a password caching tool such as Pageant. This is also
        available for download from the PuTTY website.

        Finally, setting up SSH on server and clients is a non-trivial process
        which is beyond the scope of this help file. However, you can find a
        guide in the TortoiseSVN FAQ listed under
        <ulink url="http://tortoisesvn.net/ssh_howto">
            <citetitle>Subversion/TortoiseSVN SSH How-To</citetitle>
