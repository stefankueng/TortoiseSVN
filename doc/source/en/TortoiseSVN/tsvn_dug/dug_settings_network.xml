			Here you can configure your proxy server, if you need one to get
			through your company's firewall.

		<para>
			If you need to set up per-repository proxy settings, you will
			need to use the Subversion <literal>servers</literal> file to
			configure this. Use <guibutton>Edit</guibutton> to get there
			directly. Consult the
			<ulink url="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07.html#svn-ch-7-sect-1.3.1">
				<citetitle>Subversion Manual</citetitle>
			</ulink>
			for details on how to use this file.

			You can also specify which program TortoiseSVN should use to
			establish a secure connection to a svn+ssh repository.
			We recommend that you use TortoisePlink.exe. This is a version
			of the popular Plink program, and is included with TortoiseSVN,
			but it is compiled as a Windowless app, so you don't get a DOS
			box popping up every time you authenticate.
		</para>
		<para>
			One side-effect of not having a window is that there is
			nowhere for any error messages to go, so if authentication
			fails you will simply get a message saying something like
			<quote>Unable to write to standard output</quote>.
			For this reason we recommend that you first set up using
			standard Plink. When everything is working, you can use
			TortoisePlink with exactly the same parameters.
