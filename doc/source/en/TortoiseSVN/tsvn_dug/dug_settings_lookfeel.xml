		This page allows you to choose the items for which TortoiseSVN will
		display icon overlays. Network drives can be very slow, so by default
		icons are not shown for working copies located on network shares.
		You can even disable all icon overlays, but where's the fun in that?
	</para>
	<para>
		USB Flash drives appear to be a special case in that the drive type
		is identified by the device itself. Some appear as fixed drives,
		and some as removable drives.
	</para>
	<para>
		By default, overlay icons and context menus will appear in all open/save
		dialogs as well as in Windows Explorer. If you want them to appear
		<emphasis>only</emphasis> in Windows Explorer, check the
		<guilabel>Show overlays and context menu only in explorer</guilabel> box.
	</para>
	<para>
		Since it takes quite a while to fetch the status of a working copy,
		TortoiseSVN uses a cache to store the status so the explorer
		doesn't get hogged too much when showing the overlays.
		You can choose which type of cache TortoiseSVN should use according
		to your system and working copy size here:
		<variablelist>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Default</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Caches all status information in a separate process
						(<filename>TSVNCache.exe</filename>). That process
						watches all drives for changes and fetches the status
						again if files inside a working copy get modified.
						The process runs with the least possible priority so
						other programs don't get hogged because of it. That 
						also means that the status information is not
						<emphasis>real time</emphasis> but it can take a few
						seconds for the overlays to change.
					</para>
					<para>
						Advantage: the overlays show the status recursively,
						i.e. if a file deep inside a working copy is modified,
						all folders up to the working copy root will also
						show the modified overlay. And since the process can
						send notifications to the shell, the overlays on the left
						tree view usually change too.
					</para>
					<para>
						Disadvantage: the process runs constantly, even if you're not 
						working on your projects. It also uses around 10-50 MB of RAM 
						depending on number and size of your working copies.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Shell</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Caching is done directly inside the shell extension
						dll, but only for the currently visible folder.
						Each time you navigate to another folder, the status
						information is fetched again.
					</para>
					<para>
						Advantage: needs only very little memory (around 1 MB of RAM)
						and can show the status in <emphasis>real time</emphasis>.
					</para>
					<para>
						Disadvantage: Since only one folder is cached, the overlays
						don't show the status recursively. For big working copies,
						it can take more time to show a folder in explorer than
						with the default cache. Also the mime-type column is not
						available.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>None</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						With this setting, the TortoiseSVN does not fetch the status
						at all in Explorer. Because of that, files don't get an overlay
						and folders only get a 'normal' overlay if they're versioned.
						No other overlays are shown, and no extra columns are available
						either.
					</para>
					<para>
						Advantage: uses absolutely no additional memory and does
						not slow down the Explorer at all while browsing.
					</para>
					<para>
						Disadvantage: Status information of files and folders is not
						shown in Explorer. To see if your working copies are modified,
						you have to use the "Check for modifications" dialog.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
		</variablelist>
	</para>
	<para>
		If you select the default option, you can also choose to mark folders as
		modified if they contain unversioned items. This could be useful for
		reminding you that you have created new files which are not yet versioned.
	</para>
	<para>
		The <guilabel>Exclude Paths</guilabel> are used to tell TortoiseSVN
		those paths for which it should <emphasis>not</emphasis> show icon
		overlays and status columns.
		This is useful if you have some very big working copies containing
		only libraries which you won't change at all and therefore don't
		need the overlays. For example:
	</para>
	<para>
		<filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion</filename> will disable
		the overlays <emphasis>only</emphasis> on that specific folder. You
		still can see the overlays on all files and folder inside that folder.
	</para>
	<para>
		<filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion*</filename> will disable the
		overlays on <emphasis>all</emphasis> files and folders whose path
		starts with <filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion</filename>. That
		means you won't see overlays for any files and folders below that
		path.
	</para>
	<para>
		The same applies to the <guilabel>Include Paths</guilabel>. Except that
		for those paths the overlays are shown even if the overlays are disabled
		for that specific drive type, or by an exclude path specified above.
	</para>
	<para>
		Users sometimes ask how these three settings interact, and the definitive
		answer is:
<screen>
if (path is in include list)
  show overlays
if (path is allowed drive type) AND (path is not in exclude list)
  show overlays
</screen>
		The include list <emphasis>always</emphasis> makes the overlays show.
		Otherwise, overlays are shown for all marked drive types
		<emphasis>unless</emphasis> the path is excluded.
	</para>
	<para>
		TSVNCache.exe also uses these paths to restrict its scanning. If you
		want it to look only in particular folders, disable all drive types
		and include only the folders you specifically want to be scanned.
	</para>
	<para>
		Sometimes you will exclude areas that contain working copies,
		which saves TSVNCache from scanning and monitoring for changes,
		but you still want a visual indication that such folders are versioned.
		The <guilabel>Show excluded folders as 'normal'</guilabel> checkbox
		allows you to do this. With this option, versioned folders in any
		excluded area (drive type not checked, or specifically excluded)
		will show up as normal and up-to-date, with a green check
		mark. This reminds you that you are looking at a working copy, even
		though the folder overlays may not be correct. Files do not get an
		overlay at all. Note that the context menus still work, even though
		the overlays are not shown.
	</para>
	<para>
		As a special exception to this, drives <literal>A:</literal>
		and <literal>B:</literal> are never considered for the
		<guilabel>Show excluded folders as 'normal'</guilabel> option.
		This is because Windows is forced to look on the drive, which can
		result in a delay of several seconds when starting Explorer, even
		if your PC does have a floppy drive.
