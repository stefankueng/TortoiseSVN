        This page allows you to choose the items for which TortoiseSVN will
        display icon overlays.

    <para>
        Since it takes quite a while to fetch the status of a working copy,
        TortoiseSVN uses a cache to store the status so the explorer
        doesn't get hogged too much when showing the overlays.
        You can choose which type of cache TortoiseSVN should use according
        to your system and working copy size here:
        <variablelist>
            <varlistentry>
                <term>Default</term>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        Caches all status information in a separate process
                        (<filename>TSVNCache.exe</filename>). That process
                        watches all drives for changes and fetches the status
                        again if files inside a working copy get modified.
                        The process runs with the least possible priority so
                        other programs don't get hogged because of it. That
                        also means that the status information is not
                        <emphasis>real time</emphasis> but it can take a few
                        seconds for the overlays to change.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Advantage: the overlays show the status recursively,
                        i.e. if a file deep inside a working copy is modified,
                        all folders up to the working copy root will also
                        show the modified overlay. And since the process can
                        send notifications to the shell, the overlays on the left
                        tree view usually change too.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Disadvantage: the process runs constantly, even if you're not
                        working on your projects. It also uses around 10-50 MB of RAM
                        depending on number and size of your working copies.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </varlistentry>
            <varlistentry>
                <term>Shell</term>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        Caching is done directly inside the shell extension
                        dll, but only for the currently visible folder.
                        Each time you navigate to another folder, the status
                        information is fetched again.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Advantage: needs only very little memory (around 1 MB of RAM)
                        and can show the status in <emphasis>real time</emphasis>.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Disadvantage: Since only one folder is cached, the overlays
                        don't show the status recursively. For big working copies,
                        it can take more time to show a folder in explorer than
                        with the default cache. Also the mime-type column is not
                        available.
                    </para>
                </listitem>

            <varlistentry>
                <term>None</term>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        With this setting, the TortoiseSVN does not fetch the status
                        at all in Explorer. Because of that, files don't get an overlay
                        and folders only get a 'normal' overlay if they're versioned.
                        No other overlays are shown, and no extra columns are available
                        either.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Advantage: uses absolutely no additional memory and does
                        not slow down the Explorer at all while browsing.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Disadvantage: Status information of files and folders is not
                        shown in Explorer. To see if your working copies are modified,
                        you have to use the <quote>Check for modifications</quote> dialog.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>
    </para>
    <para>
        By default, overlay icons and context menus will appear in all open/save
        dialogs as well as in Windows Explorer. If you want them to appear
        <emphasis>only</emphasis> in Windows Explorer, check the
        <guilabel>Show overlays and context menu only in explorer</guilabel> box.
    </para>
    <para>
        You can also choose to mark folders as
        modified if they contain unversioned items. This could be useful for
        reminding you that you have created new files which are not yet versioned.
        This option is only available when you use the <emphasis>default</emphasis>
        status cache option (see below).
    </para>
    <para>
        The next group allows you to select which classes of storage should
        show overlays. By default, only hard drives are selected.
        You can even disable all icon overlays, but where's the fun in that?
    </para>
    <para>
        Network drives can be very slow, so by default
        icons are not shown for working copies located on network shares.
    </para>
    <para>
        USB Flash drives appear to be a special case in that the drive type
        is identified by the device itself. Some appear as fixed drives,
        and some as removable drives.
    </para>
    <para>
        The <guilabel>Exclude Paths</guilabel> are used to tell TortoiseSVN
        those paths for which it should <emphasis>not</emphasis> show icon
        overlays and status columns.
        This is useful if you have some very big working copies containing
        only libraries which you won't change at all and therefore don't
        need the overlays, or if you only want TortoiseSVN to look in
        specific folders.
    </para>
    <para>
        Any path you specify here is assumed to apply recursively, so none of the
        child folders will show overlays either. If you want to exclude
        <emphasis>only</emphasis> the named folder, append <literal>?</literal>
        after the path.
    </para>
    <para>
        The same applies to the <guilabel>Include Paths</guilabel>. Except that
        for those paths the overlays are shown even if the overlays are disabled
        for that specific drive type, or by an exclude path specified above.
    </para>
    <para>
        Users sometimes ask how these three settings interact. For any given path
        check the include and exclude lists, seeking upwards through the directory
        structure until a match is found. When the first match is found, obey that
        include or exclude rule. If there is a conflict, a single directory spec
        takes precedence over a recursive spec, then inclusion takes precedence over
        exclusion.
    </para>
    <para>
        An example will help here:
<screen>
Exclude:
       C:
       C:\develop\?
       C:\develop\tsvn\obj
       C:\develop\tsvn\bin

Include:
       C:\develop
</screen>
        These settings disable icon overlays for the C: drive, except for
        <literal>c:\develop</literal>. All projects below that directory will
        show overlays, except the <literal>c:\develop</literal> folder itself,
        which is specifically ignored. The high-churn binary folders are also
        excluded.
    </para>
    <para>
        TSVNCache.exe also uses these paths to restrict its scanning. If you
        want it to look only in particular folders, disable all drive types
        and include only the folders you specifically want to be scanned.
    </para>
    <tip>
        <title>Exclude <literal>SUBST</literal> Drives</title>
        <indexterm>
            <primary>SUBST drives</primary>
        </indexterm>
        <para>
            It is often convenient to use a <literal>SUBST</literal> drive
            to access your working copies, e.g. using the command
<screen>
subst T: C:\TortoiseSVN\trunk\doc
</screen>
            However this can cause the overlays not to update, as
            <literal>TSVNCache</literal> will only receive one notification when
            a file changes, and that is normally for the original path. This means
            that your overlays on the <literal>subst</literal> path may never
            be updated.
        </para>
        <para>
            An easy way to work around this is to exclude the original path
            from showing overlays, so that the overlays show up on the
            <literal>subst</literal> path instead.
        </para>
    </tip>
    <para>
        Sometimes you will exclude areas that contain working copies,
        which saves TSVNCache from scanning and monitoring for changes,
        but you still want a visual indication that a folder contains a working copy.
        The <guilabel>Show excluded root folders as 'normal'</guilabel> checkbox
        allows you to do this. With this option, working copy root folders in any
        excluded area (drive type not checked, or specifically excluded)
        will show up as normal and up-to-date, with a green check
        mark. This reminds you that you are looking at a working copy, even
        though the folder overlays may not be correct. Files do not get an
        overlay at all. Note that the context menus still work, even though
        the overlays are not shown.
    </para>
    <para>
        As a special exception to this, drives <literal>A:</literal>
        and <literal>B:</literal> are never considered for the
        <guilabel>Show excluded folders as 'normal'</guilabel> option.
        This is because Windows is forced to look on the drive, which can
        result in a delay of several seconds when starting Explorer, even
        if your PC does have a floppy drive.

            You can change the overlay icon set to the one you like best.
            Note that if you change overlay set, you may have to restart
            your computer for the changes to take effect.

            </figure>
            Because the number of overlays available is severely restricted,
            you can choose to disable some handlers to ensure that the ones
            you want will be loaded. Because TortoiseSVN uses the common
            TortoiseOverlays component which is shared with other Tortoise
            clients (e.g. TortoiseCVS, TortoiseHg) this setting will affect
            those clients too.
