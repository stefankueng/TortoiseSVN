        For your convenience, TortoiseSVN saves many of the settings
        you use, and remembers where you have been lately. If you
        want to clear out that cache of data, you can do it here.

                    Whenever you checkout a working copy, merge changes
                    or use the repository browser, TortoiseSVN keeps a record
                    of recently used URLs and offers them in a combo box.
                    Sometimes that list gets cluttered with outdated URLs
                    so it is useful to flush it out periodically.

                <para>
                    If you want to remove a single item from one of the combo
                    boxes you can do that in-place. Just click on the arrow
                    to drop the combo box down, move the mouse over the item
                    you want to remove and type <keycap>Shift+Del</keycap>.

                <para>
                    TortoiseSVN stores recent commit log messages that you
                    enter. These are stored per repository, so if you access many
                    repositories this list can grow quite large.

            <listitem>
                <para>
                    TortoiseSVN caches log messages fetched by the Show Log
                    dialog to save time when you next show the log. If someone
                    else edits a log message and you already have that message
                    cached, you will not see the change until you clear the
                    cache. Log message caching is enabled on the
                    <guilabel>Log Cache</guilabel> tab.

                    Many dialogs remember the size and screen position that you

                <para>
                    When you authenticate with a Subversion server, the username
                    and password are cached locally so you don't have to keep
                    entering them. You may want to clear this for security reasons,
                    or because you want to access the repository under a different
                    username ... does John know you are using his PC?
                </para>
                <para>
                    If you want to clear authentication data for one particular server only,
                    use the <guibutton>Clear...</guibutton> instead of the
                    <guibutton>Clear all</guibutton> button.

                <para>
                    TortoiseSVN keeps a log of everything written to its progress
                    dialogs. This can be useful when, for example, you want to check
                    what happened in a recent update command.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The log file is limited in length and when it grows too big the
                    oldest content is discarded. By default 4000 lines are kept, but
                    you can customize that number.
                </para>
                <para>
                    From here you can view the log file content, and also clear it.
