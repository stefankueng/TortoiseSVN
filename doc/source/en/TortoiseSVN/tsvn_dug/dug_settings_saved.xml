			For your convenience, TortoiseSVN saves many of the settings
			you use, and remembers where you have been lately. If you
			want to clear out that cache of data, you can do it here.

				<term>URL history</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Whenever you checkout a working copy, merge changes
						or use the repository browser, TortoiseSVN keeps a record
						of recently used URLs and offers them in a combo box.
						Sometimes that list gets cluttered with outdated URLs
						so it is useful to flush it out periodically.

				<term>Log messages</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						TortoiseSVN stores recent commit log messages that you
						enter. These are stored per repository, so if you access many
						repositories this list can grow quite large.

				<listitem>

				<term>Authentication data</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						When you authenticate with a Subversion server, the username
						and password are cached locally so you don't have to keep
						entering them. You may want to clear this for security reasons,
						or because you want to access the repository under a different
						username ... does John know you are using his PC?
					</para>
					<para>
						If you want to clear auth data for one particular server only,
						read <xref linkend="tsvn-dug-general-auth"/> for instructions
						on how to find the cached data.
