    <para>
        It is very common in Software Development for changes to be related to a specific
        bug or issue ID. Users of bug tracking systems (issue trackers) would like to associate
        the changes they make in Subversion with a specific ID in their issue tracker.
        Most issue trackers therefore provide a pre-commit hook script which parses the log
        message to find the bug ID with which the commit is associated.
        This is somewhat error prone since it relies on the user to write the log message
        properly so that the pre-commit hook script can parse it correctly.
    </para>
    <para>
        TortoiseSVN can help the user in two ways:
        <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    When the user enters a log message, a well defined line including
                    the issue number associated with the commit can be added automatically.
                    This reduces the risk that the user enters the issue number in a way
                    the bug tracking tools can't parse correctly.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Or TortoiseSVN can highlight the part of
                    the entered log message which is recognized by the issue tracker.
                    That way the user knows that the log message can be parsed correctly.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    When the user browses the log messages, TortoiseSVN
                    creates a link out of each bug ID in the log message which fires
                    up the browser to the issue mentioned.
                </para>

        <title>Adding Issue Numbers to Log Messages</title>
        <para>
            You can integrate a bug tracking tool of your choice in
            TortoiseSVN. To do this, you have to define
            some properties, which start with <literal>bugtraq:</literal>.
            They must be set on Folders: (<xref linkend="tsvn-dug-propertypage"/>)
        </para>
        <para>
            <figure id="tsvn-dug-bugtraq-dia">
                <title>The Bugtraq Properties Dialog</title>
                <graphic fileref="../images/PropEditBugtraq.png"/>
            </figure>
            When you edit any of the bugtraq properties a special property
            editor is used to make it easier to set appropriate values.
        </para>
        <para>
            There are two ways to integrate TortoiseSVN with issue trackers. One is
            based on simple strings, the other is based on
            <emphasis>regular expressions</emphasis>.
            The properties used by both approaches are:
            <variablelist>
                <varlistentry>
                    <term condition="pot">bugtraq:url</term>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Set this property to the URL of your bug tracking tool.
                            It must be properly URI encoded and it has to contain
                            <literal>%BUGID%</literal>.
                            <literal>%BUGID%</literal> is replaced with the Issue number
                            you entered. This allows TortoiseSVN
                            to display a link in the log dialog, so when you are looking
                            at the revision log you can jump directly to your
                            bug tracking tool.
                            You do not have to provide this property, but then
                            TortoiseSVN shows only the
                            issue number and not the link to it.
                            e.g the TortoiseSVN project is using
                            <systemitem class="url">http://issues.tortoisesvn.net/?do=details&amp;id=%BUGID%</systemitem>.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            You can also use relative URLs instead of absolute ones. This is
                            useful when your issue tracker is on the same domain/server
                            as your source repository. In case the domain name ever changes,
                            you don't have to adjust the <literal>bugtraq:url</literal> property.
                            There are two ways to specify a relative URL:
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            If it begins with the string <literal>^/</literal> it is assumed
                            to be relative to the repository root.
                            For example, <literal>^/../?do=details&amp;id=%BUGID%</literal>
                            will resolve to
                            <systemitem class="url">http://tortoisesvn.net/?do=details&amp;id=%BUGID%</systemitem>
                            if your repository is located on
                            <systemitem class="url">http://tortoisesvn.net/svn/trunk/</systemitem>.
                        </para>
                        <para>
                            A URL beginning with the string <literal>/</literal> is assumed
                            to be relative to the server's hostname.
                            For example <literal>/?do=details&amp;id=%BUGID%</literal>
                            will resolve to
                            <systemitem class="url">http://tortoisesvn.net/?do=details&amp;id=%BUGID%</systemitem>
                            if your repository is located anywhere on
                            <systemitem class="url">http://tortoisesvn.net</systemitem>.
                        </para>
                    </listitem>

                            Set this to <literal>true</literal>, if you want
                            TortoiseSVN to warn you
                            because of an empty issue-number text field. Valid values
                            are <literal>true/false</literal>.

            <para>
                In the simple approach, TortoiseSVN shows the user a separate
                input field where a bug ID can be entered. Then a separate line
                is appended/prepended to the log message the user entered.

                                This property activates the bug tracking system
                                in <emphasis>Input field</emphasis> mode.
                                If this property is set, then TortoiseSVN
                                will prompt you to enter an issue number when you commit
                                your changes. It's used to add a line at the end of the
                                log message. It must contain
                                <literal>%BUGID%</literal>, which is replaced with the
                                issue number on commit. This ensures that your commit log
                                contains a reference to the issue number which is always
                                in a consistent format and can be parsed by your
                                bug tracking tool to associate the issue number with a
                                particular commit. As an example you might use
                                <literal>Issue : %BUGID%</literal>,
                                but this depends on your Tool.

                                Keep in mind though that the window will not be resized
                                to fit this label, so keep the size of the label below

            <title>Issue Numbers Using Regular Expressions</title>
            <para>
                In the approach with <emphasis>regular expressions</emphasis>, TortoiseSVN
                doesn't show a separate input field but marks the part of the log message
                the user enters which is recognized by the issue tracker. This is done while
                the user writes the log message. This also means that the bug ID can be
                anywhere inside a log message! This method is much more flexible, and is
                the one used by the TortoiseSVN project itself.
                <variablelist>
                    <varlistentry>
                        <term condition="pot">bugtraq:logregex</term>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>
                                This property activates the bug tracking system
                                in <emphasis>Regex</emphasis> mode.
                                It contains either a single regular expressions,
                                or two regular expressions separated by a newline.
                            </para>
                            <para>
                                If two expressions are set, then the first expression is used as
                                a pre-filter to find expressions which contain bug IDs. The
                                second expression then extracts the bare bug IDs from the
                                result of the first regex. This allows you to use a list
                                of bug IDs and natural language expressions if you wish.
                                e.g. you might fix several bugs and include a string something
                                like this:
                                <quote>This change resolves issues #23, #24 and #25</quote>.
                            </para>
                            <para>
                                If you want to catch bug IDs as used in the expression above
                                inside a log message, you could use the following regex strings,
                                which are the ones used by the TortoiseSVN project:
                                <literal>[Ii]ssues?:?(\s*(,|and)?\s*#\d+)+</literal> and
                                <literal>(\d+)</literal>.
                            </para>
                            <para>
                                The first expression picks out <quote>issues #23, #24 and #25</quote>
                                from the surrounding log message.
                                The second regex extracts plain decimal numbers from the output
                                of the first regex, so it will return <quote>23</quote>, <quote>24</quote>
                                and <quote>25</quote> to use as bug IDs.
                            </para>
                            <para>
                                Breaking the first regex down a little, it must start with
                                the word <quote>issue</quote>, possibly capitalised.
                                This is optionally followed by an <quote>s</quote> (more than one
                                issue) and optionally a colon. This is followed by one or more
                                groups each having zero or more leading whitespace, an optional
                                comma or <quote>and</quote> and more optional space. Finally there
                                is a mandatory <quote>#</quote> and a mandatory decimal number.

                                If only one expression is set, then the bare bug IDs must be
                                matched in the groups of the regex string. Example:
                                <literal>[Ii]ssue(?:s)? #?(\d+)</literal>
                                This method is required by a few issue trackers, e.g. trac,
                                but it is harder to construct the regex. We recommend that you
                                only use this method if your issue tracker documentation
                                tells you to.

                                It's not always easy to get the regex right so to help out there is
                                a test dialog built into the bugtraq properties dialog. Click on
                                the button to the right of the edit boxes to bring it up. Here you
                                can enter some test text, and change each regex to see the results.
                                If the regex is invalid the edit box background changes to red.

                Even if you don't have an issue tracker with a pre-commit hook parsing your
                log messages, you still can use this to turn the issues mentioned in your
                log messages into links!

            <para>
                And even if you don't need the links, the issue numbers show up as a

                which relate to a particular issue.

            Some <literal>tsvn:</literal> properties require a
            <literal>true/false</literal> value. TortoiseSVN also understands
            <literal>yes</literal> as a synonym for <literal>true</literal> and
            <literal>no</literal> as a synonym for <literal>false</literal>.

            <title>Set the Properties on Folders</title>
            <para>
                These properties must be set on folders for the system to work.
                When you commit a file or folder the properties are read from that folder.
                If the properties are not found there, TortoiseSVN will search upwards
                through the folder tree to find them until it comes to an unversioned
                folder, or the tree root (e.g. <literal>C:\</literal>) is found.
                If you can be sure that each user checks out only from e.g
                <filename>trunk/</filename> and not some sub-folder, then it's enough if
                you set the properties on <filename>trunk/</filename>.
                If you can't be sure, you should set the properties recursively
                on each sub-folder.
                A property setting deeper in the project hierarchy overrides settings on
                higher levels (closer to <filename>trunk/</filename>).
            </para>
            <para>
                For project properties <emphasis>only</emphasis>,
                i.e. <literal>tsvn:</literal>, <literal>bugtraq:</literal>
                and <literal>webviewer:</literal>
                you can use the <guilabel>Recursive</guilabel> checkbox to set
                the property to all sub-folders in the hierarchy, without also
                setting it on all files.

            When you add new sub-folders to a working copy using TortoiseSVN, any
            project properties present in the parent folder
            will automatically be added to the new child folder too.

            <title>No Issue Tracker Information from Repository Browser</title>
            <para>
                Because the issue tracker integration depends upon accessing Subversion
                properties, you will only see the results when using a checked
                out working copy. Fetching properties remotely is a slow operation,
                so you will not see this feature in action from the repo browser
                unless you started the repo browser from your working copy. If you
                started the repo browser by entering the URL of the repository
                you won't see this feature.
            </para>
            <para>
                For the same reason, project properties will not be propagated
                automatically when a child folder is added using the repo browser.

        <title>Getting Information from the Issue Tracker</title>
        <para>
            The previous section deals with adding issue information to the
            log messages. But what if you need to get information from the issue
            tracker? The commit dialog has a COM interface which allows
            integration an external program that can talk to your tracker.
            Typically you might want to query the tracker to get a list of
            open issues assigned to you, so that you can pick the issues that
            are being addressed in this commit.
        </para>
        <para>
            Any such interface is of course highly specific to your issue tracker system,
            so we cannot provide this part, and describing how to create such a
            program is beyond the scope of this manual. The interface definition
            and sample plugins in C# and C++/ATL can be obtained from the <literal>contrib</literal>
            folder in the
            <ulink url="http://tortoisesvn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/contrib/issue-tracker-plugins">
                <citetitle>TortoiseSVN repository</citetitle>
            </ulink>.
            (<xref linkend="tsvn-preface-source"/> explains how to access the repository.)
            A summary of the API is also given in <xref linkend="tsvn-ibugtraqprovider"/>.

            Another (working) example plugin in C# is
            <ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/gurtle/">
                <citetitle>Gurtle</citetitle>
            </ulink>
            which implements the required COM interface to interact with the
            <ulink url="http://code.google.com/hosting/">
                <citetitle>Google Code</citetitle>
            </ulink>
            issue tracker.
        </para>
        <para>
            For illustration purposes, let's suppose that your system administrator
            has provided you with an issue tracker plugin which you have installed,
            and that you have set up some of your working copies to use the plugin
            in TortoiseSVN's settings dialog.
            When you open the commit dialog from a working copy to which the plugin
            has been assigned, you will see a new button at the top of the dialog.
            <figure id="tsvn-dug-bugtracker-dia-1">
                <title>Example issue tracker query dialog</title>
                <graphic fileref="../images/IssueTrackerQuery.png"/>
            </figure>
            In this example you can select one or more open issues. The plugin
            can then generate specially formatted text which it adds to your log
            message.
