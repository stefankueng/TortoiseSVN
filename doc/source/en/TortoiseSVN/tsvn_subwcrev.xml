		<para>
			SubWCRev is Windows console program which can be used to read
			the status of a Subversion working copy and optionally perform
			keyword substitution in a template file.
			This is often used as part of the build process as a means of
			incorporating working copy information into the object you
			are building. Typically it might be used to include the
			revision number in an <quote>About</quote> box.

		<title>The SubWCRev Command Line</title>
		<para>
			SubWCRev reads the Subversion status of all files in a working
			copy, excluding externals by default. It records the highest commit
			revision number found, and the commit timestamp of that revision,
			It also records whether there are local modifications in the working
			copy, or mixed update revisions. The revision number, update
			revision range and modification status are displayed on stdout.
		</para>
		<para>
			SubWCRev.exe is called from the command line or a script, and
			is controlled using the command line parameters.
<screen>
SubWCRev WorkingCopyPath [SrcVersionFile DstVersionFile] [-nmdfe]
</screen>
		</para>
		<para>
			<literal>WorkingCopyPath</literal> is the path to the working
			copy being checked. You can only use SubWCRev on working copies,
			not directly on the repository. The path may be absolute or
			relative to the current working directory.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you want SubWCRev to perform keyword substitution, so that
			fields like repository revision and URL are saved to a text
			file, you need to supply a template file
			<literal>SrcVersionFile</literal>
			and an output file
			<literal>DstVersionFile</literal>
			which contains the substituted version of the template.
		</para>
		<para>
			There are a number of optional switches which affect the way
			SubWCRev works. If you use more than one, they must be specified
			as a single group, eg.
			<literal>-nm</literal>, not
			<literal>-n -m</literal>.

								If this switch is given, SubWCRev will exit with

						<row>
							<entry>-m</entry>
							<entry>
								If this switch is given, SubWCRev will exit with

								mixed revisions. This may be used to prevent
								building with a partially updated working copy.

						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>-f</entry>
							<entry>
								If this switch is given, SubWCRev will include
								the last-changed revision of folders. The default
								behaviour is to use only files when getting the
								revision numbers.
							</entry>
						</row>
						<row>
							<entry>-e</entry>
							<entry>
								If this switch is given, SubWCRev will examine
								directories which are included with svn:externals,
								but only if they are from the same repository.
								The default behaviour is to ignore externals.
