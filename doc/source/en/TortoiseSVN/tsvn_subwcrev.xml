            SubWCRev is Windows console program which can be used to read
            the status of a Subversion working copy and optionally perform
            keyword substitution in a template file.
            This is often used as part of the build process as a means of
            incorporating working copy information into the object you
            are building. Typically it might be used to include the
            revision number in an <quote>About</quote> box.

        <title>The SubWCRev Command Line</title>
        <para>
            SubWCRev reads the Subversion status of all files in a working
            copy, excluding externals by default. It records the highest commit
            revision number found, and the commit timestamp of that revision,
            it also records whether there are local modifications in the working
            copy, or mixed update revisions. The revision number, update
            revision range and modification status are displayed on stdout.
        </para>
        <para>
            SubWCRev.exe is called from the command line or a script, and
            is controlled using the command line parameters.

        </para>
        <para>
            <literal>WorkingCopyPath</literal> is the path to the working
            copy being checked. You can only use SubWCRev on working copies,
            not directly on the repository. The path may be absolute or
            relative to the current working directory.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you want SubWCRev to perform keyword substitution, so that
            fields like repository revision and URL are saved to a text
            file, you need to supply a template file
            <literal>SrcVersionFile</literal>
            and an output file
            <literal>DstVersionFile</literal>
            which contains the substituted version of the template.
        </para>
        <para>
            There are a number of optional switches which affect the way
            SubWCRev works. If you use more than one, they must be specified
            as a single group, e.g.
            <literal>-nm</literal>, not
            <literal>-n -m</literal>.

                                behaviour is to use only files when getting the

                                but only if they are from the same repository.
                                The default behaviour is to ignore externals.

                                but it ignores the externals with explicit revisions,
                                when the revision range inside of them is only
                                the given explicit revision in the properties.
                                So it doesn't lead to mixed revisions.

                                status on stdout.

            If there is no error, SubWCRev returns zero. But in case
            an error occurs, the error message is written to stderr
            and shown in the console. And the returned error codes are:

                                after the &amp; char. For example:

                                in the working copy, with the value
                                after the + or - char added or subtracted.
                                For example:
                                <literal>$WCREV-1000$</literal>
                            </entry>

                            <entry>
                                Replaced with the commit date/time of the
                                highest commit revision. By default,
                                international format is used:
                                <literal>yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss</literal>.
                                Alternatively, you can specify a custom format which
                                will be used with <literal>strftime()</literal>,
                                for example:
                                <literal>$WCDATE=%a %b %d %I:%M:%S %p$</literal>.
                                For a list of available formatting characters, look at the

                                the working copy. If the working copy is in a
                                consistent state, this will be a single revision.
                                If the working copy contains mixed revisions,
                                either due to being out of date, or due to a
                                deliberate update-to-revision, then the range
                                will be shown in the form 100:200.

            SubWCRev does not directly support nesting of expressions, so for example
            you cannot use an expression like:
<screen>
#define SVN_REVISION    "$WCMIXED?$WCRANGE$:$WCREV$$"
</screen>
            But you can usually work around it by other means, for example:
<screen>
#define SVN_RANGE       $WCRANGE$
#define SVN_REV         $WCREV$
#define SVN_REVISION    "$WCMIXED?SVN_RANGE:SVN_REV$"
</screen>

                Some of these keywords apply to single files rather than to
                an entire working copy, so it only makes sense to use these
                when SubWCRev is called to scan a single file. This applies to
                <literal>$WCINSVN$</literal>,

                A file like this will be included in the build so you would expect it
                to be versioned. Be sure to version the template file, not the
                generated file, otherwise each time you regenerate the version file
                you need to commit the change, which in turn means the version file
                needs to be updated.

            If you need to access Subversion revision information from other
            programs, you can use the COM interface of SubWCRev. The object to
            create is <literal>SubWCRev.object</literal>, and the following
            methods are supported:

                                This method traverses the working copy gathering the
                                revision information. Naturally you must call this before
                                you can access the information using the remaining methods.
                                The first parameter is the path.
                                The second parameter should be true if you want to include
                                folder revisions. Equivalent to the <literal>-f</literal>
                                command line switch.
                                The third parameter should be true if you want to include
                                svn:externals. Equivalent to the <literal>-e</literal>
                                command line switch.
