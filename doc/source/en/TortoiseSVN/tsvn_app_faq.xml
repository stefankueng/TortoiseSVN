            Because TortoiseSVN is being developed all the time
            it is sometimes hard to keep the documentation completely
            up to date. We maintain an
            <ulink url="http://tortoisesvn.net/faq.html">
                <citetitle>online FAQ</citetitle>
            </ulink>
            which contains a selection of the questions we are asked
            the most on the TortoiseSVN mailing lists
            <email>dev@tortoisesvn.tigris.org</email> and
            <email>users@tortoisesvn.tigris.org</email>.

        <para>
            We also maintain a project
            <ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/tortoisesvn/wiki/IssueTracker?tm=3">
                <citetitle>Issue Tracker</citetitle>
            </ulink>
            which tells you about some of the things we have on our To-Do list,
            and bugs which have already been fixed. If you think you have found
            a bug, or want to request a new feature, check here first to see
            if someone else got there before you.

            If you have a question which is not answered anywhere
            else, the best place to ask it is on one of the mailing lists:
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
            <email>users@tortoisesvn.tigris.org</email> is the one to use
            if you have questions about using TortoiseSVN.
