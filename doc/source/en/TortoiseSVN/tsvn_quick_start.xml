			This section is aimed at people who would like to find out what
			TortoiseSVN is all about and give it a test drive. It explains

			Naturally it doesn't explain everything - this is just the Quick
			Start Guide after all. Once you are up and running you should take
			the time to read the rest of this user guide, which takes you
			through things in much more detail. It also explains more about
			setting up a proper Subversion server.
