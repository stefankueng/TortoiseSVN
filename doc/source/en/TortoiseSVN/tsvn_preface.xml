            Version control is the art of managing changes to
            information. It has long been a critical tool for programmers,
            who typically spend their time making small changes to software
            and then undoing or checking some of those changes the next day.
            Imagine a team of such developers working concurrently - and perhaps even
            simultaneously on the very same files! - and you can see why
            a good system is needed to <emphasis>manage the potential chaos</emphasis>.

        <title>What is TortoiseSVN?</title>
        <para>
            TortoiseSVN is a free open-source Windows client for the
            <firstterm>Apache&#x2122; Subversion&#x00ae;</firstterm> version control system.
            That is, TortoiseSVN manages files and directories over time.
            Files are stored in a central <firstterm>repository</firstterm>.
            The repository is much like an ordinary file server, except that it
            remembers every change ever made to your files and directories.
            This allows you to recover older versions of your files and examine
            the history of how and when your data changed, and who changed it.
            This is why many people think of Subversion and version control
            systems in general as a sort of <quote>time machine</quote>.
        </para>
        <para>
            Some version control systems are also software configuration
            management (SCM) systems.  These systems are specifically
            tailored to manage trees of source code, and have many features
            that are specific to software development - such as natively
            understanding programming languages, or supplying tools for
            building software.  Subversion, however, is not one of these
            systems; it is a general system that can be used to manage
            <emphasis>any</emphasis> collection of files, including
            source code.

            What makes TortoiseSVN such a good Subversion client?
            Here's a short list of features.

                        TortoiseSVN integrates seamlessly into the Windows shell
                        (i.e. the explorer). This means you can keep working
                        with the tools you're already familiar with. And you
                        do not have to change into a different application
                        each time you need the functions of version control.

                    <para>
                        And you are not limited to using the Windows Explorer;
                        TortoiseSVN's context menus work in many other file managers,
                        and also in the File/Open dialog which is common to most
                        standard Windows applications.
                        You should, however, bear in mind that TortoiseSVN
                        is intentionally developed as an extension for the Windows
                        Explorer. Thus it is possible that in other applications
                        the integration is not as complete and e.g. the icon
                        overlays may not be shown.

                        Subversion has an abstracted notion of repository

                        network server is a module for the Apache web server,
                        which speaks a variant of HTTP called WebDAV/DeltaV.
                        This gives Subversion a big advantage in stability and
                        interoperability, and provides various key features for
                        free: authentication, authorization, wire compression,
                        and repository browsing, for example. A smaller,
                        standalone Subversion server process is also available.
                        This server speaks a custom protocol which can be
                        easily tunneled over ssh.

                        Subversion expresses file differences using a binary

                        text (human-readable) and binary (human-unreadable) files.
                        Both types of files are stored equally compressed in the
                        repository, and differences are transmitted in both
                        directions across the network.

                        The cost of branching and tagging need not be
                        proportional to the project size. Subversion creates
                        branches and tags by simply copying the project, using
                        a mechanism similar to a hard-link.
                        Thus these operations take only a very small,
                        constant amount of time, and very little space in the repository.

            <para>
                In 2002, Tim Kemp found that Subversion was a very good version
                control system, but it lacked a good GUI client. The idea for a
                Subversion client as a Windows shell integration was inspired by
                the similar client for CVS named TortoiseCVS.
                Tim studied the source code of TortoiseCVS and used it as a base for
                TortoiseSVN. He then started the project, registered the domain
                <literal>tortoisesvn.org</literal> and put the source code online.
            </para>
            <para>
                Around that time, Stefan Küng was looking for a good and free version
                control system and found Subversion and the source for TortoiseSVN.
                Since TortoiseSVN was still not ready for use, he joined the project
                and started programming. He soon rewrote most of the existing code and
                started adding commands and features, up to a point where nothing of
                the original code remained.
            </para>
            <para>
                As Subversion became more stable it attracted more and more users
                who also started using TortoiseSVN as their Subversion client.
                The user base grew quickly (and is still growing every day).
                That's when Lübbe Onken offered to help out with some nice icons
                and a logo for TortoiseSVN. He now takes care of the website
                and manages the many translations.

        <para>
            This book is written for computer-literate folk who want to use
            Subversion to manage their data, but prefer to use a GUI client rather
            than a command line client. TortoiseSVN is a windows shell extension
            and it is assumed that the user is familiar with the windows
            explorer and how to use it.
        </para>
        <para>
            This <xref linkend="tsvn-preface"/> explains what TortoiseSVN is,
            a little about the TortoiseSVN project and the community of people who
            work on it, and the licensing conditions for using it and distributing it.
        </para>
        <para>
            The <xref linkend="tsvn-quick-start"/> explains how to install TortoiseSVN
            on your PC, and how to start using it straight away.
        </para>
        <para>
            In <xref linkend="tsvn-basics"/> we give a short introduction
            to the <emphasis>Subversion</emphasis> revision control system which
            underlies TortoiseSVN. This is borrowed from the documentation for the
            Subversion project and explains the different approaches to version
            control, and how Subversion works.
        </para>
        <para>
            The chapter on <xref linkend="tsvn-repository"/> explains how to set up
            a local repository, which is useful for testing Subversion and TortoiseSVN
            using a single PC. It also explains a bit about repository administration
            which is also relevant to repositories located on a server.
            There is also a section here on how to setup a server if you need one.
        </para>
        <para>
            The <xref linkend="tsvn-dug"/> is the most important section as
            it explains all the main features of TortoiseSVN and how to use them.
            It takes the form of a tutorial, starting with checking out a working copy,
            modifying it, committing your changes, etc. It then progresses to more
            advanced topics.
        </para>
        <para>
            <xref linkend="tsvn-subwcrev"/> is a separate program included with TortoiseSVN
            which can extract the information from your working copy and write it into a
            file. This is useful for including build information in your projects.
        </para>
        <para>
            The <xref linkend="tsvn-howto"/> section answers some common questions
            about performing tasks which are not explicitly covered elsewhere.
        </para>
        <para>
            The section on <xref linkend="tsvn-automation"/> shows how the
            TortoiseSVN GUI dialogs can be called from the command line. This is useful
            for scripting where you still need user interaction.
        </para>
        <para>
            The <xref linkend="tsvn-cli"/> give a correlation
            between TortoiseSVN commands and their equivalents in the Subversion
            command line client <literal>svn.exe</literal>.
