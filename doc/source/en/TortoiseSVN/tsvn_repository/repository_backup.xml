        Whichever type of repository you use, it is vitally important
        that you maintain regular backups, and that you verify the
        backup. If the server fails, you may be able to access a
        recent version of your files, but without the repository
        all your history is lost forever.

    <para>
        The simplest (but not recommended) way is just to copy the
        repository folder onto the backup medium. However, you have
        to be absolutely sure that no process is accessing the data.
        In this context, access means <emphasis>any</emphasis>
        access at all. A BDB repository is written to even when
        the operation only appears to require reading, such as getting
        status. If your repository is accessed at all during the copy,
        (web browser left open, WebSVN, etc.) the backup will be worthless.

        The recommended method is to run
<screen>
svnadmin hotcopy path/to/repository path/to/backup --clean-logs
</screen>
        to create a copy of your repository in a safe manner. Then backup
        the copy. The <literal>--clean-logs</literal> option is not
        required, but removes any redundant log files when you backup
        a BDB repository, which may save some space.

        The <literal>svnadmin</literal> tool is installed automatically
        when you install the Subversion command line client. The easiest
        way to get this is to check the option to include the command
        line tools when installing TortoiseSVN, but if you prefer you can
        download the latest version of command line tools directly from the
