    Whichever type of repository you use, it is vitally important
    that you maintain regular backups, and that you verify the
    backup. If the server fails, you may be able to access a
    recent version of your files, but without the repository
    all your history is lost forever.
  </para>
  <para>
    The simplest (but not recommended) way is just to copy the
    repository folder onto the backup medium. However, you have
    to be absolutely sure that no process is accessing the data.
    In this context, access means <emphasis>any</emphasis>
    access at all. If your repository is accessed at all during the copy,
    (web browser left open, WebSVN, etc.) the backup will be worthless.

    The recommended method is to run
    <screen>
svnadmin hotcopy path/to/repository path/to/backup
    </screen>
    to create a copy of your repository in a safe manner. Then backup
    the copy.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <literal>svnadmin</literal> tool is installed automatically
    when you install the Subversion command line client. The easiest
    way to get this is to check the option to include the command
    line tools when installing TortoiseSVN, but if you prefer you can
    download the latest version of command line tools directly from the
