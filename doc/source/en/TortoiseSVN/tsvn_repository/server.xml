    <title>Accessing the Repository</title>
    <para>
        To use TortoiseSVN (or any other Subversion client), you need a place where your
        repositories are located. You can either store your repositories locally and access
        them using the <literal>file://</literal> protocol or you can place them on a
        server and access them with the <literal>http://</literal> or
        <literal>svn://</literal> protocols.
        The two server protocols can also be encrypted.
        You use <literal>https://</literal> or <literal>svn+ssh://</literal>,
        or you can use <literal>svn://</literal> with SASL.

        If you are using a public hosting service such as
        <ulink url="http://code.google.com/hosting/">
            <citetitle>Google Code</citetitle>
        </ulink>
        or your server has already been setup by someone else then there is
        nothing else you need to do. Move along to <xref linkend="tsvn-dug"/>.
    </para>
    <para>
        If you don't have a server and you work alone, or if you are just evaluating
        Subversion and TortoiseSVN in isolation, then local repositories are
        probably your best choice. Just create a repository on your own PC as
        described earlier in <xref linkend="tsvn-repository"/>. You can skip the
        rest of this chapter and go directly to <xref linkend="tsvn-dug"/> to find
        out how to start using it.

        If you were thinking about setting up a multi-user repository on a network
        share, think again. Read <xref linkend="tsvn-repository-local-share"/>
        to find out why we think this is a bad idea. Setting up a server is not as
        hard as it sounds, and will give you better reliability and probably speed too.

        The next sections are a step-by-step guide on how you can set up such
        a server on a Windows machine. Of course you can also set up a
        server on a Linux machine, but that is beyond the scope of this guide.
        More detailed information on the Subversion server options, and how
        to choose the best architecture for your situation, can be
        found in the Subversion book under
        <ulink url="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.serverconfig.html">
