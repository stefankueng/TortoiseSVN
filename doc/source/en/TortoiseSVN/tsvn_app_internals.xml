            implementation of some of TortoiseSVN's features.

        <para>
            Every file and folder has a Subversion status value as reported
            by the Subversion library. In the command line client, these
            are represented by single letter codes, but in TortoiseSVN they
            are shown graphically using the icon overlays. Because the number
            of overlays is very limited, each overlay may represent one of
            several status values.
        </para>
        <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/ConflictIcon.png"/>
            The <emphasis>Conflicted</emphasis> overlay is used to
            represent the <literal>conflicted</literal> state, where
            an update or switch results in conflicts between local
            changes and changes downloaded from the repository. It is
            also used to indicate the <literal>obstructed</literal> state,
            which can occur when an operation is unable to complete.
        </para>
        <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/ModifiedIcon.png"/>
            The <emphasis>Modified</emphasis> overlay represents the
            <literal>modified</literal> state, where you have made
            local modifications, the <literal>merged</literal> state,
            where changes from the repository have been merged with
            local changes, and the <literal>replaced</literal> state,
            where a file has been deleted and replaced by another
            different file with the same name.
        </para>
        <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/DeletedIcon.png"/>
            The <emphasis>Deleted</emphasis> overlay represents the
            <literal>deleted</literal> state, where an item is scheduled for
            deletion, or the <literal>missing</literal> state, where an
            item is not present. Naturally an item which is missing cannot have
            an overlay itself, but the parent folder can be marked if one of its
            child items is missing.
        </para>
        <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/AddedIcon.png"/>
            The <emphasis>Added</emphasis> overlay is simply used to
            represent the <literal>added</literal> status when an item
            has been added to version control.
        </para>
        <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/InSubVersionIcon.png"/>
            The <emphasis>In Subversion</emphasis> overlay is used to
            represent an item which is in the <literal>normal</literal>
            state, or a versioned item whose state is not yet known.
            Because TortoiseSVN uses a background caching process to
            gather status, it may take a few seconds before the overlay
            updates.
        </para>
        <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/ReadOnlyIcon.png"/>
            The <emphasis>Needs Lock</emphasis> overlay is used to
            indicate when a file has the <literal>svn:needs-lock</literal>
            property set.
        </para>
        <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/LockedIcon.png"/>
            The <emphasis>Locked</emphasis> overlay is used when the local
            working copy holds a lock for that file.
        </para>
        <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/IgnoredIcon.png"/>
            The <emphasis>Ignored</emphasis> overlay is used to
            represent an item which is in the <literal>ignored</literal>
            state, either due to a global ignore pattern, or the
            <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property of the parent folder.
            This overlay is optional.
        </para>
        <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/UnversionedIcon.png"/>
            The <emphasis>Unversioned</emphasis> overlay is used to
            represent an item which is in the <literal>unversioned</literal>
            state. This is an item in a versioned folder, but which is not
            under version control itself.
            This overlay is optional.
        </para>
        <para>
            If an item has Subversion status <literal>none</literal> (the item
            is not within a working copy) then no overlay is shown.
            If you have chosen to disable the <emphasis>Ignored</emphasis>
            and <emphasis>Unversioned</emphasis> overlays then no overlay
            will be shown for those files either.
        </para>
        <para>
            An item can only have one Subversion status value. For example
            a file could be locally modified and it could be marked for
            deletion at the same time. Subversion returns a single status
            value - in this case <literal>deleted</literal>.
            Those priorities are defined within Subversion itself.
        </para>
        <para>
            When TortoiseSVN displays the status recursively (the default
            setting), each folder displays an overlay reflecting its own
            status and the status of all its children. In order to display
            a single <emphasis>summary</emphasis> overlay, we use the
            priority order shown above to determine which overlay to use,
            with the <emphasis>Conflicted</emphasis> overlay taking highest
            priority.
        </para>
        <para>
            In fact, you may find that not all of these icons are used on your
            system. This is because the number of overlays allowed by Windows
            is limited to 15. Windows uses 4 of those, and the remaining 11
            can be used by other applications. If there are not enough overlay
            slots available, TortoiseSVN tries to be a
            <emphasis>Good Citizen (TM)</emphasis> and limits its use of overlays to
            give other apps a chance.
        </para>
        <para>
            Since there are Tortoise clients available for other version control
            systems, we've created a shared component which is responsible for
            showing the overlay icons. The technical details are not important
            here, all you need to know is that this shared component allows
            all Tortoise clients to use the same overlays and therefore the
            limit of 11 available slots isn't used up by installing more than one
            Tortoise client. Of course there's one small drawback: all Tortoise
            clients use the same overlay icons, so you can't figure out by
            the overlay icons what version control system a working copy is
            using.
