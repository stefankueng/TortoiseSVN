		Sometimes you need to work directly on the repository, without having
		a working copy. That's what the <firstterm>Repository Browser</firstterm>
		is for. Just as the explorer and the icon overlays allow you to view your
		working copy, so the Repository Browser allows you to view the structure
		and status of the repository.

		With the Repository Browser you can execute commands like copy, move,
		rename, ... directly on the repository.

	<para>
		On the top of the Repository Browser Window you can enter the URL of
		the repository and the revision you want to browse. Browsing an older
		revision is useful if you want to e.g. recover a previously deleted
		file. Use the 
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Copy To...</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		command to do that and enter the full working copy path to where
		you want to recover your deleted file.
	</para>
	<para>
		You can also use the repository browser for drag-and-drop operations.
		If you drag a folder from explorer into the repo browser, it will be
		imported into the repository. Note that if you drag multiple items,
		they will be imported in separate commits.
