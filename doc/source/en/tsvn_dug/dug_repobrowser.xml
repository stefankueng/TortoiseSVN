		Sometimes you need to work directly on the repository, without having
		a working copy. That's what the <firstterm>Repository Browser</firstterm>
		is for. What the explorer and the icon overlays are for your working
		copy is the Repository Browser for the repository.

		With the Repository Browser you can execute commands like copy, move,
		rename, ... directly on the repository.

	<para>
		On the top of the Repository Browser Window you can enter the URL of
		the repository and the revision you want to browse. Browsing an older
		revision is useful if you want to e.g. recover a previously deleted
		file. Use the 
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenuitem>Copy To...</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		command to do that and enter the full working copy path to where
		you want to recover your deleted file.
