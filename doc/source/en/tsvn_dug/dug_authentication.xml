		Enter you username and password. The checkbox will make TortoiseSVN store
		the credentials in Subversion's default directory: 
		<filename>$APPDATA\Subversion\auth</filename>. One file for each server
		that you access. If you want to make Subversion and TortoiseSVN forget your
		credentials, you have to delete the corresponding file(s).

				Under Windows 2000 and above the credentials are stored encrypted
				in the registry. To delete the credentials go to the settings dialog
				and press <guibutton>Clear Auth Cache</guibutton>.
