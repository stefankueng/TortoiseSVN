		Unlike CVS, Subversion allows renaming and moving of files and
		folders. So there are menu entries for delete and rename
		in the TortoiseSVN submenu.

	<para>
		If you delete a file/directory using TSVN, the file is
		removed from your working copy and marked for deletion.
		The file's parent folder shows a "deleted" icon overlay.
		You can always get the file back, if you call
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenuitem>revert</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		on the parent folder.
	</para>
	<para>
		If you want to move files inside a working copy,
		use the drag-and-drop handler again:
		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					select the files or directories you want to move
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<action>right-drag</action> them to the
					new location inside the working copy
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					release the right mouse button
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					in the popup menu select
					<menuchoice>
						<guimenuitem>move files in Subversion to here</guimenuitem>
					</menuchoice>
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>
		If a file is deleted via the explorer but not removed from
		version control (i.e. you delete a file as usual), the commit
		dialog shows those files and lets you remove them from
		version control too before the commit. So it doesn't really
		matter, if you forget to delete the file with TortoiseSVN as
		you are supposed to do.

			<title>Commit the parent folder</title>
			<para>
				Since renames and moves are done as a delete followed by an
				add you must commit the parent folder of the renamed/moved
				file. Only that way the deleted part of the rename/move will
				show up in the commit dialog. If you don't commit the removed
				part of the rename/move, it will stay behind in the repository
				and an update of your coworkers won't remove the old file.

			<title>Getting a deleted file or folder back</title>
			<para>
				If you have deleted a file or a folder and already committed
				that delete operation to the repository, then a normal 
				<menuchoice>
					<guimenuitem>Revert</guimenuitem>
				</menuchoice>
				can't bring it back anymore. But the file or folder is not
				lost at all. If you know the revision the file or folder got
				deleted (if you don't, use the log dialog to find out) open
				the repository browser and switch to that revision. Then select
				the file or folder you deleted, right-click and select
				<menuchoice>
					<guimenuitem>Copy to...</guimenuitem>
				</menuchoice>
				as the target for that copy operation select the path to your
				working copy.
