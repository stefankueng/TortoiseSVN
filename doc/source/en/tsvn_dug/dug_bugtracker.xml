			You could integrate a Bugtracking Tool of your choice in <application>TortoiseSVN</application>. 
			Therefore you have to define some Properties, which start with <literal>bugtraq:</literal>. They must be set on 
			Directories: (<xref linkend="tsvn-DUG-propertypage"/>)
			<variablelist>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>bugtraq:message</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<emphasis>This property activates the Bugtracking System. </emphasis>
							If this property is set, then <application>TortoiseSVN</application> will
							prompt you to enter an issue number when you commit your changes. 
							It's used to add a line at the end of the logmessage. It must contain
							<literal>%BUGID%</literal>, which is replaced with the issuenumber on commit. 
							This ensures that your commit log contains a reference to the issuenumber
							which is always in a consistent format and can be parsed by your
							Bugtracking tool to associate the issuenumber with a particular commit. 
							e.g the TortoiseSVN project is using <literal>Issue : %BUGID%</literal>, 
							but this depends on your Tool.
						</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>bugtraq:url</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
							Set this property to the url of your bugtracking tool. It must be 
							properly URI encoded and it has to contain <literal>%BUGID%</literal>.
							<literal>%BUGID%</literal> is replaced with the Issuenumber you entered.
							This allows <application>TortoiseSVN</application> to display a link
							in the log dialog, so when you are looking at the revision log you can
							jump directly to your bugtracking tool.
							You do not have to provide this property, but then
							<application>TortoiseSVN</application> shows only the issuenumber
							and not the link to it. e.g the TortoiseSVN project is using
							<literal>http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=%BUGID%</literal>
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>bugtraq:label</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
							This text is shown by <application>TortoiseSVN</application> on
							the commit dialog to label the edit box where you enter the issuenumber. 
							If it's not set, <literal>Bug-ID / Issue-Nr:</literal> will be displayed.
							Keep in mind though that the window will not be resized to fit this label,
							so keep the size of the label below 20-25 characters. 
						</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>bugtraq:number</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
							If it's set to <literal>true</literal> only numbers are allowed in the issuenumber textfield.
							An exception is the comma, so you could comma separate several numbers.
							Valid values are <literal>true/false</literal>. 
							<emphasis>If not defined, <literal>true</literal> is assumed.</emphasis>
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>bugtraq:warnifnoissue</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
							Set this to <literal>true</literal>, if you want
							<application>TortoiseSVN</application>
							to warn you because of an empty issuenumber textfield. Valid values 
							are <literal>true/false</literal>.
							<emphasis>If not defined, <literal>true</literal> is assumed.</emphasis>
					</para>
				</listitem>

			<title>Set the Properties on Directories</title>
			<para>
					These properties must be set on directories for the system to work. 
					If you can be sure that each user checks out only from e.g <filename>trunk/</filename>
					and not some subfolder, then it's enough if you set the properties on <filename>trunk/</filename>.
					<application>TortoiseSVN</application> will then search for those properties 
					the path up to the working copy root for those properties.
					If you can't be sure, you have to set the properties recursively on each subfolder.
					A property setting deeper in the project hierarchy overrides settings on
					higher levels (closer to <filename>trunk/</filename>).
