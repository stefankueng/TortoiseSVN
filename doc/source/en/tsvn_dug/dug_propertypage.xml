		Sometimes you want to have a more detailed information
		about a file/directory than just the icon overlay.
		You can get all the information Subversion provides in the
		explorer properties dialog. Just select the file or
		directory and select
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>Windows Menu</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>properties</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		in the context menu (note: this is the normal properties menu entry
		the explorer provides, not in the TortoiseSVN submenu!).
		In the properties dialog box TortoiseSVN has added a new
		property page for files/folders under Subversion control.
	</para>
	<para>
		On the Subversion page you can see all relevant
		information about the selected file/directory. In
		addition you can read and set the Subversion properties.
		You can add your own properties, or some properties with a 
		special meaning in Subversion. These begin with <literal>svn:</literal>. 
		<literal>svn:externals</literal> is such a property; see how to handle
		externals in <xref linkend="tsvn-DUG-import-4"/>.
		For more information about properties in Subversion see the  
		<ulink url="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html#svn-ch-7-sect-2.3">

		To set a property, select the required property name from the
		combo box, then type in a value in the field below. Properties which
		take multiple values, such as an ignore list, can be entered on
		multiple lines. Click on <guibutton>Set</guibutton> to add that
		property to the list.
	</para>
	<para>
		If you want to apply the property to <emphasis>every</emphasis> file
		and folder in the hierarchy below the current folder, check the
		<guilabel>Recursive</guilabel> checkbox.
	</para>

		If you wish to edit an existing property, first select that property
		from the list of existing properties, so that it appears in the edit
		area. Then procede as for a new property.
	</para>

		If you wish to remove an existing property, select that property
		from the list of existing properties, so that it appears in the edit
		area. Then click on <guibutton>Remove</guibutton>.

		TortoiseSVN has a few special properties of its own, and these begin
		with <literal>tsvn:</literal>.
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<literal>tsvn:logminsize</literal>
					sets the minimum length of a log message for a commit.
					If you enter a shorter message than specified here, the commit
					is disabled. This feature is very useful for reminding you to
					supply a proper descriptive message for every commit.
					If this property is not set,
					or the value is zero, empty log messages are allowed.
				</para>
				<para>
					<literal>tsvn:lockmsgminsize</literal>
					sets the minimum length of a lock message.
					If you enter a shorter message than specified here, the lock
					is disabled. This feature is very useful for reminding you to
					supply a proper descriptive message for every lock you get.
					If this property is not set,
					or the value is zero, empty lock messages are allowed.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<literal>tsvn:logwidthmarker</literal> is used with projects which
					require log messages to be formatted with some maximum width
					(typically 80 characters) before a line break. Setting this
					property to a non-zero will do 2 things in the log message
					entry dialog: it places a marker to indicate the maximum width,
					and it disables word wrap in the display, so that you can see
					whether the text you entered is too long. Note: this feature
					will only work correctly if you have a fixed-width font
					selected for log messages.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<literal>tsvn:logtemplate</literal> is used with projects which
					have rules about log message formatting. The property holds
					a multi-line text string which will be inserted in the commit
					message box when you start a commit. You can then edit it to
					include the required information. Note: if you are also using
					<literal>tsvn:logminsize</literal>, be sure to set the length
					longer than the template or you will lose the protection mechanism.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					In the Commit dialog you have the option to paste in the
					list of changed files, including the status of each file
					(added, modified, etc).
					<literal>tsvn:logfilelistenglish</literal> defines whether
					the file status is inserted in english or in the localized
					language. If the property is not set, the default is
					<literal>true</literal>. 
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					TortoiseSVN can use spell checker modules which are also
					used by OpenOffice and Mozilla. If you have those installed
					this property will determine which spell checker to use, i.e.
					in which language the log messages for your project should
					be written.
					<literal>tsvn:projectlanguage</literal> sets the language
					module the spell checking engine should use when you enter
					a log message. You can find the values for your language
					on this page:
					<ulink url="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/intl/nls_238z.asp">

	<para>
		Some <literal>tsvn:</literal> properties require a
		<literal>true/false</literal> value. TSVN also understands
		<literal>yes</literal> as a synonym for <literal>true</literal> and
		<literal>no</literal> as a synonym for <literal>false</literal>.
	</para>
	<important>
		<title>Set the tsvn: properties on folders</title>
		<para>
			These <literal>tsvn:</literal> properties must be set on
			<emphasis>folders</emphasis> for the system to work. 
			When you commit a file or folder the properties are read from that folder.
			If the properties are not found there, TortoiseSVN will search upwards
			through the folder tree to find them until it comes to an unversioned
			folder, or the tree root (eg. <literal>C:\</literal>) is found.
			If you can be sure that each user checks out only from e.g
			<filename>trunk/</filename> and not some subfolder, then it is
			sufficient to set the properties on <filename>trunk/</filename>.
			If you can't be sure, you should set the properties recursively on each subfolder.
			A property setting deeper in the project hierarchy overrides settings on
			higher levels (closer to <filename>trunk/</filename>).
		</para>
		<para>
			For <literal>tsvn:</literal> properties <emphasis>only</emphasis>
			you can use the <guilabel>Recursive</guilabel> checkbox to set
			the property to all subfolders in the hierarchy, without also
			setting it on all files.
		</para>
	</important>
	<important>
		<title>Commit properties</title>
		<para>
			Subversion properties are versioned. After you change or add a 
			property you have to commit your changes.
		</para>
	</important>
	<tip>
		<title>Conflicts on properties</title>
		<para>
			If there's a conflict on committing the changes, because another 
			user has changed the same property, Subversion generates a 
			<filename>.prej</filename> file. Delete this file after you 
			have resolved the conflict. 
		</para>
	</tip>
	<tip>
		<title>Automatic property setting</title>
		<para>
			You can configure Subversion to set properties automatically 
			on files and folders when they are added to the repository.
			Read <xref linkend="tsvn-DUG-settings"/> for further information. 
		</para>
	</tip>
	<para>
		TortoiseSVN can integrate with some bugtracking 
		tools. This uses properties, which start with <literal>bugtraq:</literal>.
		Read <xref linkend="tsvn-DUG-bugtracker"/> for further information.
