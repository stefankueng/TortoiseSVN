	<para>
		For every change you make and commit, you also have to provide
		a log message for that change. That way you can later find out
		what/why you made a change and you have a detailed log for your
		development process.
	</para>
	<para>
		The Log Dialog retrieves all those log messages and shows them
		to you.
		The display is divided into 3 panes.
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The top pane shows a list of revisions where changes to the
					file/folder have been committed. This summary includes the
					date and time, the person who committed the revision and the
					start of the log message.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The middle pane shows the full log message for the selected
					revision.
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The bottom pane shows a list of all files and folders that
					were changed as part of the selected revision.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		But it does much more than that - it provides context menu
		commands which you can use to get even more information about the
		project history.

			</figure>
				The top pane of the Log Dialog has a context menu that allows you to
				<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Compare the selected revision with your working copy.
						The default Diff-Tool is TortoiseMerge which
						is supplied with TortoiseSVN. This will show you a list
						of changed files, and allow you to review the changes made
						to each file individually.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						View the changes made in the selected revision as a
						Unified-Diff file. If you select 2 revisions, then the
						differences between these 2 selected revisions are shown.
						This helps you find out exactly what changed between revisions.
						The Unified-Diff operation is faster than invoking the "normal" external
						diff viewer because TortoiseSVN doesn't have to fetch the
						whole file but only the difference.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Save the selected revision to a file so you have an older
						version of that file. This option is only available when
						you access the log for a file, and it saves a version of
						that one file only.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Open the repository browser to examine the selected folder.
						This option is only available when you access the log for
						a directory.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Create a branch/tag from a selected revision.
						This is useful e.g. if you forgot to create a tag and already
						committed some changes which weren't supposed to get into
						that release.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Update your working copy to the selected
						revision. Useful if you want to have your working copy reflect
						a time in the past. It is best to update a whole directory
						in your working copy, not just one file, otherwise your
						working copy will be inconsistent and you will be unable to
						commit any changes.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Revert changes from which were made in the selected
						revision. The changes are reverted in your working copy so
						this operation does <emphasis>not</emphasis> affect the
						repository at all! Note that this will undo the changes
						made in that revision only. It does not replace your
						working copy with the entire file at the earlier revision.
						This is very useful for undoing an earlier change when
						other unrelated changes have been made since.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Search log messages for the text you enter. This searches
						the log messages that you entered and also the action summaries
						created by Subversion (shown in the bottom pane). The search
						is not case sensitive.

		<title>Getting all log messages</title>
		<para>
			The Log Dialog does not always show all changes ever made for a
			number of reasons:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						For a large repository there may be hundreds or even
						thousands of changes and fetching them all could take
						a long time. Normally you are only interested in the
						more recent changes. By default, the number of log
						messages fetched is limited to 100, but you can change
						this value in 
						<menuchoice>
							<guimenuitem>Settings</guimenuitem>
						</menuchoice>
						(<xref linkend="tsvn-DUG-settings"/>),
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						When you check the log messages for a branch (or tag),
						Show Log only displays log messages back to the root
						of that particular branch - the point where the copy
						was made. This gives a quick indication of the changes
						that were made in that branch only.
					</para>
					<para>
						Note that this only applies in your working copy.
						If you are using the repo-browser, log messages
						continue through branch points.

		<title>Changing the log message and author</title>
		<para>
			Sometimes you might want to change a log message you once entered,
			maybe because there's a spelling error in it or you want to
			improve the message or change it for other reasons. Or you want to
			change the author of the commit because you forgot to set up
			authentication or...
		</para>
		<para>
			Subversion lets you change both the log message and the author
			of revisions any time you want. But since such changes can't be
			undone (those changes are not versioned) this feature is disabled
			by default. To make this work, you must set up a pre-revprop-change
			and a post-revprop-change hook. Please refer to the Subversion Book
			for details about how to do that.
		</para>
		<para>
			Once you've set up your server with the required hooks, you can
			change both author and log message of any revision. To do that with
			TortoiseSVN you must <action>doubleclick</action> on either the
			author or logmessage column in the log dialog while holding down
			the SHIFT-key. If you don't press the SHIFT-key or don't click on
			one of these columns the default doubleclick action is executed
			(showing a diff of that revision).
		</para>
		<warning>
			<para>
				Because Subversion's revision properties are not versioned, making 
				modifications to such a property (for example, the <literal>svn:log</literal> commit 
				message property) will overwrite the previous value of that 
				property <emphasis>forever</emphasis>.
