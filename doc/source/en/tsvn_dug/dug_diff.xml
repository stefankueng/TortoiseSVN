	<para>
		One of the commonest requirements in project development is to
		see what has changed. You might want to look at the differences
		between two revisions of the same file, or the differences between
		two separate files.
		TortoiseSVN provides some builtin tools for this, and also
		allows you to use your own favourite diff program.

						If you want to see the changes made to all files
						in a particular revision in one view, you can
						use Unified-Diff output (GNU patch format). This shows
						only the differences with a few lines of context. It
						is harder to read than a visual file compare, but will
						show all the changes together. From the Revision Log
						dialog select the revision of interest, then select
						<guimenuitem>Show Differences as Unified-Diff</guimenuitem>
						from the context menu.

		The builtin tools supplied with TortoiseSVN do not support viewing
