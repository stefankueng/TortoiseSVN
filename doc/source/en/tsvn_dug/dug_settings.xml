						Exclude files or directories by typing in the names or extensions.
						Patterns are separated by spaces e.g.
						<literal>*/bin */obj *.bak *.~?? *.jar *.[Tt]mp</literal>.
						The first two entries refer to directories, the 
						other four to files.

						This exclude pattern will affect all your projects.
						It is not versioned, so it will not affect other users.

						If you are developing software it is generally best

			This page allows you to specify which of the TortoiseSVN context menu

		</para>
		<para>
			If you have a very large number of files in your working copy

			when you <action>right click</action> on a folder. This is because
			Subversion fetches the status for all files when you ask for
			folder status. To avoid this delay you can uncheck the
			<guilabel>Fetch status for context menu</guilabel>
			box. Be warned that the context menu for folders will not always
			be correct, and may include items which should not really be there.
			For example, you will see
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Show Log</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>
			for an <literal>Added</literal> folder, which will not work because

					<title>The Settings Dialog, Look and Feel Page</title>
					<graphic fileref="images/SettingsOverlay.png"/>
				</figure>
				This page allows you to choose the items for which TortoiseSVN will
				display icon overlays. Network drives can be very slow, so by default
				icons are not shown for working copies located on network shares.
				You can even disable all icon overlays, but where's the fun in that?
			</para>
			<para>
				By default, overlay icons will appear in all open/save dialogs
				as well as in Windows Explorer. If you want them to appear
				<emphasis>only</emphasis> in Windows Explorer, check the
				<guilabel>Show overlays only in explorer</guilabel> box.
			</para>
			<para>
				Normally the icon overlays act recursively, which means that the
				overlay for a folder shows the most significant status of all its
				subfolders. If there is a modified file deep in the hierarchy,
				the top level folder will also show modified status to remind you
				that there are buried changes.
				If you have <emphasis>very</emphasis> large working copies then
				you may find that the recursive status feature causes too much
				disk activity and disruption on your system, although this is not
				usually a problem. In that case you can uncheck
				<guilabel>Show overlay status icons recursively</guilabel> so
				that folder status is shown only for the folder itself.
			</para>
			<para>
				The <guilabel>Exclude Paths</guilabel> are used to tell TortoiseSVN for which
				paths <emphasis>not</emphasis> to show icon overlays and status columns.
				This is useful if you have some very big working copies containing
				only libraries which you won't change at all and therefore don't
				need the overlays. For example:
			</para>
			<para>
				<filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion</filename> will disable
				the overlays on <emphasis>only</emphasis> that specific folder. You
				still can see the overlays on all files and folder inside that folder.
			</para>
			<para>
				<filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion*</filename> will disable the
				overlays on <emphasis>all</emphasis> files and folders whose path
				starts with <filename>f:\development\SVN\Subversion</filename>. That
				means you won't see overlays for any files and folders below that
				path.
			</para>
			<para>
				The same applies to the <guilabel>Include Paths</guilabel>. Except that
				for those paths the overlays are shown even if the overlays are disabled
				for that specific drive type.

					<term>Use old APIs to fetch log messages</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							As of version 1.2, Subversion servers support fetching a defined
							number of log messages, rather than the log messages from a range
							of revisions. With the new API, if you ask for 100 messages you
							will get 100 message. With the old API, if you ask for 100 messages
							you get the messages from the last 100 repository revisions. If your
							file didn't change often, you will see few messages.
						</para>
						<para>
							However, if you query a pre-1.2 server using the new API, it will
							return <emphasis>all</emphasis> log message which the client then
							filters. This can result in <emphasis>very</emphasis> slow reponses.
							If you have to work with an older server, you should check this
							box to avoid the slowdown. The best option of course is to upgrade
							the server.

				<varlistentry>
					<term>Progress Dialog</term>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							TortoiseSVN can automatically close all progress dialogs 
							when the action is finished without error. This setting
							allows you to select the conditions for closing the
							dialogs. The default (recommended) setting is
							<guilabel>Close manually</guilabel>
							which allows you to review all messages and check what
							has happened. However, you may decide that you want to
							ignore some types of message and have the dialog
							close automatically if there are no critical changes.
						</para>
						<para>
							<guilabel>Auto-close if no merges, adds or deletes</guilabel>
							means that the progress dialog will close if there were
							simple updates, but if changes from the repository were
							merged with yours, or if any files were added or deleted,
							the dialog will remain open.
						</para>
						<para>
							<guilabel>Auto-close if no conflicts</guilabel>
							relaxes the criteria further and will close the dialog
							even if there were merges, adds or deletes. However,
							if there were any conflicts or errors, the dialog
							remains open.
						</para>
						<para>
							<guilabel>Auto-close if no errors</guilabel>
							always closes the dialog even if there were conflicts.
							The only condition that keeps the dialog open is an
							error condition, which occurs when Subversion is unable
							to complete the task. For example, an update fails
							because the server is inaccessible, or a commit fails
							because the working copy is out-of-date.
						</para>

				An external diff program may be used for comparing different

				The window titles are not pure filenames.
				TortoiseSVN treats that as a name to display and creates
				the names accordingly. So e.g. if you're doing a
				diff from a file in revision 123 with a file 
				in your working copy, the names will be
				<filename>filename : revision 123</filename>
				and
				<filename>filename : working copy</filename>

</screen>
			</para>
			<para>
				If you use the <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property to
				expand keywords, and in particular the <literal>revision</literal>
				of a file, then there may be a difference between files which
				is purely due to the current value of the keyword. Also if you use
				<literal>svn:eol-style = native</literal> the BAsE file will have
				pure <literal>LF</literal> line endings whereas your file will
				have <literal>CR-LF</literal> line endings. TSVN will normally hide
				these differences automatically by first parsing the BASE file to
				expand keywords and line endings before doing the diff operation.
				However, this can take a long time with large files. If
				<guilabel>Convert files when diffing against BASE</guilabel>
