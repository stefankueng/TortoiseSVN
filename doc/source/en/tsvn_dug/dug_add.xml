		If you created new files and/or directories during
		your development process the you need to add them
		to source control too. Select the file(s) and/or directory
		and select the command
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenuitem>Add</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		from the context menu.
	</para>
	<para>
		After you added the files/directories to source control
		the file appears with a <literal>added</literal> icon overlay which means you
		first have to commit your working copy to make those
		files/directories available to other developers.
		Adding a file/directory does <emphasis>not</emphasis> affect
		the repository!

			You can also use the Add command on already versioned
			folders. In that case, the add dialog will show you all
			unversioned files inside that versioned folder.
			This helps if you have many new files and need them to
			add at once.

		To add files from outside your working copy you can use
		the drag-and-drop handler:
		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					select the files you want to add
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					<action>right-drag</action> them
					to the new location inside the working copy
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					release the right mouse button
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					in the popup menu select
					<menuchoice>
						<guimenuitem>add files to Subversion here</guimenuitem>
					</menuchoice>.
					The files will then be copied to the working copy and
					added to version control.
