		If your repository has for some reason changed it's
		location (IP/URL). Maybe you're even stuck and can't
		commit and you don't want to checkout your working
		copy again from the new location and to move all your
		changed data back into the new working copy,
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Relocate</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		is the command you are looking for. It basically
		does very little: it scans all "entries" files in the
		<filename>.svn</filename> folder and changes the URL of
		the entries to the new value.
