		If your repository has for some reason changed it's
		location (IP/URL). Maybe you're even stuck and can't
		commit and you don't want to checkout your working
		copy again from the new location and to move all your
		changed data back into the new working copy,
		<menuchoice>
			<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
			<guimenuitem>Relocate</guimenuitem>
		</menuchoice>
		is the command you are looking for. It basically
		does very little: it scans all "entries" files in the
		<filename>.svn</filename> folder and changes the URL of
		the entries to the new value.
	</para>
	<warning>
		<para>
			<emphasis>This is a very infrequently used operation</emphasis>.
			The Relocate command is <emphasis>only</emphasis> used if the URL of the
			repository root has changed due to a server IP address change,
			protocol change (e.g. http:// to https://) or a change of the
			repository root path in the server setup. Put another way,
			you need to relocate when your working copy is referring to the
			same location in the same repository, but the repository itself
			has moved.
		</para>
		<para>
			It does not apply if you want to move to a different Subversion
			repository. In that case you should perform a clean checkout
			from the new repository location.
		</para>
		<para>
			Nor does it apply if you want to switch to a different branch or
			directory within the same repository. To do that you should use
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Switch...</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>.
			 Read <xref linkend="tsvn-DUG-switch-1"/> for more information.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you use relocate in either of the cases above it
			<emphasis>will corrupt your working copy</emphasis> and get many
			unexplainable error messages while updating, committing, etc.
			Once that has happened, the only fix is a fresh checkout.
