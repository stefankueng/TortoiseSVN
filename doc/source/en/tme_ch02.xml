			The first thing you have to do is to decide whether you just want
			to compare/merge files, or whether you want to apply a patchfile.
			Depending on what you choose, the corresponding edit boxes and

			<title>Viewing / Merging</title>
			<para>
				If you want to compare / merge files you have to set at least two 
				of the three possible paths for <literal>Base</literal>,
				<literal>Mine</literal> and <literal>Theirs</literal>. 
				If you select only two files, then TortoiseMerge will show 
				you the differences between those two files, either in a two 
				pane view or in a one pane view. You can switch between 
				those two views with the menu command
				<menuchoice>
					<guimenu>View</guimenu>
					<guimenuitem>Oneway Diff</guimenuitem>
				</menuchoice>

				<graphic fileref="images/MergeTwoPane.png"/>
			</figure>
			<para>
				If you want to compare/merge three files, TortoiseMerge 
				will show you the differences in a three pane view. This view 
				is also used if you need to resolve conflicted files.
			</para>
			<figure id="tmerge-ch2-dia-4">
				<title>Three Pane View</title>
				<graphic fileref="images/MergeThreePane.png"/>
			</figure>
			<para>
				The left pane shows you the differences between 
				<literal>Their</literal> file and the <literal>Base</literal>
				file, while the right pane shows you the differences between
				<literal>Mine</literal> file and the <literal>Base</literal>
				file. The bottom pane shows you the result of merging
				<literal>Base</literal>, <literal>Mine</literal> and 
				<literal>Theirs</literal> with possible conflicts.
			</para>
			<para>
				The relationships between the three files are explained in
				the diagram below:

			<para>
				The base file represents the oldest version of a file, from
				where <literal>You</literal> and <literal>They</literal> start
				making changes. <literal>Mine</literal> represents 
				the base file with all the changes <emphasis>you</emphasis> made, 
				and <literal>Theirs</literal> is the file with all the changes 
				<emphasis>someone else</emphasis> made to the file.

			<title>Applying Patches</title>
			<para>
				If you want to apply a patchfile you have to set both the path
				to the patchfile itself and the path to the folder where the
				patchfile should be applied.
			</para>
			<caution>
				<para>
					Currently, only patchfiles in
					<emphasis>Unified Diff Format</emphasis> are supported.
					And only files which were generated from a Subversion
					working copy. Other formats like patchfiles generated by
					CVS are currently not supported!
				</para>
			</caution>
			<para>
				If TortoiseMerge is able to parse the patchfile it will show
				you a small window with all the files which have changes
				according to the patchfile.
				<figure id="tmerge-ch2-dia-6">
					<title>Patch Filelist</title>
					<graphic fileref="images/MergePatchWindow.png"/>
				</figure>
				If the filename is shown in black, then the patch can be applied
				without any problems. That means the file is not outdated
				according to the patch.
				However, if the filename is shown in red, then the patch can't
				get applied directly because you already changed that file.
			</para>
			<para>
				But don't worry. If you're working with Subversion you can
				retrieve an older version of the file and resolve the conflict.
				In fact, TortoiseMerge automatically tries to get that older
				version of the file and then shows you the diff between
				<literal>Base</literal> (the older version of the file),
				<literal>Mine</literal> (the file as it is currently in your
				working copy) and <literal>Theirs</literal> (the older version
				of the file with the patch already applied). Then you can
				resolve possible conflicts manually.
			</para>
			<para>
				Depending on whether TortoiseMerge can apply the patch directly
				or by fetching an older version of the file first, it shows you
				a two pane view (patch can be applied directly) or a three pane
				view (older version of file fetched).

			On the left side of the window is a locator bar. This provides
			a quick visual reference as to where the changes lie within the
			file. The bar has three columns. The left column refers to the
			left pane, the right column to the right pane, and the centre
			column to the bottom pane (if present). In one-pane view only
			the left column is used. The locator bar can also be used as a
			scroll bar to scroll all the windows simultaneously.
		</para>
		<para>
			Below the bottom window is the status bar. This shows the number of
			lines added and deleted in <literal>Theirs</literal> and
			<literal>Mine</literal>, and the number of unresolved
			conflicts remaining.
			The left side of the status bar is used to display hints when you
			hover the mouse over a control.

		<title>Merging / Editing Conflicts</title>
		<para>
			TortoiseMerge not only <emphasis>shows</emphasis> you the differences
			between files but also lets you resolve conflicts or apply changes.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you're in two pane view, then you can only edit the file in the
			right pane (<literal>Mine</literal>). To apply changes made in the
			left file (<literal>Theirs</literal>),
			<action>right-click</action> on the changed lines and select
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Use text block from <quote>theirs</quote>
				</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>.
			Then the changes from the left file are added to the right file.
		</para>
		<para>
			If you're in three pane view (sometimes called
			<emphasis>merge view</emphasis>) you can only edit the file in the
			bottom view (<literal>Merged</literal>). As in two pane view,
			you can <action>right-click</action> on conflicted
			lines and either select
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Use text block from <quote>theirs</quote>
				</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>
			or
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>Use text block from <quote>mine</quote>
				</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>.
			In addition, if you want <emphasis>both</emphasis> blocks, you can
			select
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>
					Use text block from <quote>mine</quote>
					before <quote>theirs</quote>
				</guimenuitem>

				<guimenu>Context Menu</guimenu>
				<guimenuitem>
					Use text block from <quote>theirs</quote>
					before <quote>mine</quote>
				</guimenuitem>
			</menuchoice>.
			According to the command you've selected, the changes are used
			in the resulting <literal>Merged</literal> file.
		</para>
		<para>
			Sometimes the conflict is too difficult to resolve by simply picking
			<literal>Theirs</literal> and <literal>Mine</literal> and it
			requires hand editing. TortoiseMerge allows you to do all the easy
			changes visually first and then save the file, leaving only the
			difficult changes to be resolved by hand-editing.
		</para>
		<important>
			<para>
				Note that if you use TortoiseMerge on the same files again,
				any changes to your working copy, whether in TortoiseMerge,
				or by hand-editing, <emphasis>will be discarded</emphasis>
				and the file will appear as it did when conflict-editing
				first started.
			</para>
		</important>
		<para>
			If you need to copy lines of text to insert in another file using
			your favourite text editor, you can select multiple lines to copy
			within TortoiseMerge. <action>Click</action> on the first line of
			the block, then <action>Shift+Click</action> on the last line of
			the block. As usual, <action>Ctrl+C</action> can be used to copy
			the selected lines to the clipboard.
