		<para>
		TortoiseMerge is a free/open-source application. It let's you see
		differences in text files, merge those changes and even review and
		apply unified diff files, often called <firstterm>patches</firstterm>.
		</para>
		<para>
		While working on text files, e.g. source files in your favourite
		programming language or html/xml files for your documentation or
		website, you will often have a situation where you need to compare
		different versions of those files. Sometimes you get a different
		version from someone else, sometimes you just want to see the changes
		you've made.
		</para>
		<para>
		If you're working with a version control system (e.g. Subversion) then
		you sometimes get <emphasis>conflicts</emphasis> when you update your
		working copy. This happens if someone else changed the same parts of
		the file you're currently working on as you. Then you have to resolve
		that conflict manually. This is where TortoiseMerge can help you.
		</para>
		<para>
		The following diagram shows you the relationships among the files
		involved in a conflict:

		<para>
			<graphic srccredit="file conflict" fileref="images/mergeprinciple.png"/>
		</para>
		<para>
		A conflict can also occur if you try to apply an outdated patchfile.
		In such cases you would either have to ask the person you got that
		patchfile from for a current version or try to apply that patchfile
		manually.
		</para>
		<para>
		But now with TortoiseMerge this isn't necessary anymore - at least not
		if you're working with a version control system like Subversion.
		TortoiseMerge parses the patchfile for the revision/version the patch
		was created for and automatically tries to fetch that specific version
		from your source-control, applies the patch and lets you review both
		your and their changes to the file. Then you can decide which changes
		you want to keep.

	<title>TortoiseMerge's History</title>
		
		<para>
		While working on <ulink url="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org">
		<citetitle>TortoiseSVN</citetitle></ulink> we found that 
		whenever users sent in 
		patches to enhance the project or just to fix bugs we had much work
		to just apply those patches. And many times those patches were outdated
		and couldn't get applied with the command line patch tool 
		<ulink url="http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/">
		<citetitle>http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/</citetitle></ulink>
		because we were working on those files and sometimes changed
		those files already.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		This was also the main reason why TortoiseSVN did not have a command
		"Create Patch" implemented: we rather wanted users to send us the whole
		files because with those it was easier to apply patches.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		So we spent a lot of time, searching the internet for a GUI tool which
		could apply patchfiles, but all we found was that such a tool didn't
		exist. So to make a long story short: We decided that if no one else
		is providing such a tool we'd have to write our own. That's when
		TortoiseMerge was born.
		</para>
		
		<para>
		Since TortoiseSVN already uses the Subversion library, which has a
		nice diffing engine built in it was just natural to use this library
		instead of the GNU diff. Also it reduces the size of the executable
		since TortoiseSVN and TortoiseMerge can both use the same dll's.
		</para>
