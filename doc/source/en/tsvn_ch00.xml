		<title>Audience</title>
		<para>
		This book is written for computer literate folk who want to 
		use Subversion to manage their data, but are uncomfortable using the
		command line client to do so. Since TortoiseSVN is a windows shell
		extension it's assumed that the user is familiar with the windows
		explorer and knows how to use it.
		</para>
		<para>
		Even most Subversion users will never have to set up a server 
		themselves a whole chapter deals with how to set up such a server.

		<title>TortoiseSVN is free!</title>
		<para>
			TortoiseSVN is free. You don't have to pay for it, you can use it
			any way you want. It is developed under the GP license (GPL).
		</para>
		<para>
			TortoiseSVN is an Open Source project. That means you have full
			access to the source code of this program. You can browse it
			on this link <ulink url="http://svn.collab.net/repos/tortoisesvn/">
				<citetitle>http://svn.collab.net/repos/tortoisesvn/</citetitle>
			</ulink>. The most recent version (where we're working on) is
			located under <emphasis>/trunk/</emphasis>, the released versions
			are located under <emphasis>/tags/</emphasis>.
