        Even though TortoiseSVN and TortoiseMerge are free, you can support the
        developers by sending in patches and playing an active role in the development.
        You can also help to cheer us up during the endless hours we spend in front
        of our computers.

        While working on TortoiseSVN we love to listen to music. And since we spend
        many hours on the project we need a <emphasis>lot</emphasis> of music.
        Therefore we have set up some wish-lists with our favourite music CDs and DVDs:

        Please also have a look at the list of people who contributed to the project by
        sending in patches or translations.
