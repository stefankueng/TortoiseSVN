			If you're not working in a team but working alone on a project and
			still want your work under version control you can also access
			a repository locally. This kind of repository access is also
			very handy if you just want to try out some Subversion commands
			and you don't want to change your official repository.

					You can create a repository with the FSFS backend or with the
					old but stable Berkeley Database (BDB) format. The FSFS format
					is faster and it now works on network shares and Windows 98
					without problems. The BDB format is more stable because it has
					been tested longer, but can be more difficult to administer. Read

					A repository is then created inside the new folder.

			To access your local repository you need the path to that folder.
			Just remember that Subversion expects all repository paths in the form
			<systemitem class="url">file:///C:/SVNRepository/</systemitem>
		</para>
		<para>
			To access a repository located on a network share you can either
			use drive mapping, or you can use the UNC path. For UNC paths,
			the form is
			<systemitem class="url">file:///\ServerName/path/to/repos/</systemitem>.
			Note the backslash before the server name.

		<warning>
			<para>
				Do not create or access a Berkeley DB repository on a network share.
				It <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> exist on a remote filesystem.
				Not even if you have the network drive mapped to a drive letter.
				If you attempt to use Berkeley DB on a network share,
				the results are unpredictable - you may see mysterious errors
				right away, or it may be months before you discover that your
				repository database is subtly corrupted.
			</para>
		</warning>
		<tip>
			<para>
				If you really need to access a repository through a network share,
				create the repository with fsfs format. If you need to provide
				server access as well, you will need Subversion Server 1.1 or higher.
