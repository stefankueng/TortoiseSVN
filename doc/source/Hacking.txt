Hacking the Docs
================

While you are working on the docs, please oberve the following rules for your markup.
The markup is processed by XSL Transformations, FO Processors and the like. Always
remember that you define the structure and leave the formatting to the processors
For more information about tags in docbook read http://www.docbook.org/tdg/index.html.
If you want to translate the german or french docs you have to enable UTF-8 BOM's in 
your editor.

Rules
=====
- Separate XML tags from content
  In most cases, the XML tag should be included on a line by itself,
  and the content should be indented, eg.
  <para>
  	Contents of the paragraph, which
  	may span several lines or just one.
  </para>
  Some tags are only used for a few words, eg. <emphasis> and these
  may be included inline. But please do not break such a tag over
  a line boundary. eg <emphasis>NOT
  </emphasis> like this.
  
- Use leading tabs, not spaces
  Please set up your editor NOT to expand tabs to spaces. If anyone
  else views the file with different tab settings it will look a mess.
  Recommended tab setting for viewing is 4 spaces.

- Avoid very long lines
  Most of the files have kept line length to within 80 characters when
  viewed at tabstop=4, although this is not rigidly adhered to. Using
  very long lines just makes the file harder to read and edit.

- Emphasis
  Don't use capitalization to emphasize,
  use <emphasis>Important</emphasis> instead

- Key / Mouse Actions
  If you want to say: "Press Alt-A to abort", use the following markup:
  Click on <action>ALT+A</action> to abort
  If you want to say: "Do a right click to abort", use the following markup:
  Do a <action>right click</action> to abort
  For consistency, please use 'left click' instead of 'left-click' or
  'leftclick'. The same applies to 'right click' and 'double click'.

- Gui Buttons
  If you want to say: "Click on OK to continue", use the following markup:
  Click on <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to continue

- Gui Menus
  If you want to say: "Select Commit from the TortoiseSVN menu", use the following
  markup, with layout shown:
  Select
  <menuchoice>
  	<guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>
  	<guimenuitem>Commit</guimenuitem>
  </menuchoice>

- Gui Labels / Fields
  If you want to say: "Select the URL from the URL Combobox", use the following markup:
  "Select the URL from the <guilabel>URL</guilabel> Combobox"

- User input, system output and properties are marked with <literal> like: 
  "Enter <literal>something</literal> to continue"
  "The <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property"

- Typing on a command line is marked with <command> like:
  "Enter <command>DIR/W</command> at the command prompt.

- Multiline input/output or file content is marked using <screen>.
  Note that any leading spaces are also included in the formatting,
  so this text normally appears hard against the left margin in the
  XML source file. The <screen> tag should also be left aligned. eg.
  the content of the Apache config file is shown as follows:
<screen>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
DAV svn
SVNParentPath D:\SVN
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Subversion repositories"
AuthUserFile passwd
#AuthzSVNAccessFile svnaccessfile
Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

- Figures (graphics) should use a format like this:
  <figure id="tsvn-DUG-settings-dia-1">
	<title>The Settings Dialog, Main Tab</title>
	<graphic fileref="images/SettingsMain.png"/>
  </figure>

- Links:
  Use this <xref linkend="tsvn-DUG-import-4"/> to reference internal sections.
  Use ulink for external links. This should be formatted as
  as shown below:
  <ulink url="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">
  	<citetitle>SVN book</citetitle>
  </ulink>.

- A list of bullet points is declared as follows:
  <itemizedlist>
  	<listitem>
  		paragraphs in point 1
  	</listitem>
  	<listitem>
  		paragraphs in point 2
  	</listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  Each paragraph should be enclosed in <para> tags.

- A numbered list is declared as follows:
  <orderedlist>
  	<listitem>
  		paragraphs in point 1
  	</listitem>
  	<listitem>
  		paragraphs in point 2
  	</listitem>
  </orderedlist>
  Each paragraph should be enclosed in <para> tags.

- A list with headings for each item is declared as follows:
  <variablelist>
  	<varlistentry>
  		<term>First heading</term>
  		<listitem>
  			paragraphs in point 1
  		</listitem>
  	</varlistentry>
  	<varlistentry>
  		<term>Second heading</term>
  		<listitem>
  			paragraphs in point 2
  		</listitem>
  	</varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
  Each paragraph should be enclosed in <para> tags.

- Mark Filenames with <filename>Hacking.txt</filename>

- Mark URLS with <systemitem class="url">file:///C:/SVNRepository/</systemitem>

- Mark application names with <application>TortoiseSVN</application>

- Place markers where you want an index entry to point to:
  <indexterm>
  	<primary>text to go in index</primary>
  </indexterm>

- Avoid quotes (" or ').
  Use <literal> instead, because normally you refer to input or output text.
  If you really want to quote something, use <quote>Hello, world</quote>.
  Using literal quote characters can cause 'overflow' errors during
  formatting.

- Don't use literal '<' and '>' marks
  The XML interpreter will get confused as they look like tag chars.
  Use &lt; for < and &gt; for >
  
Use the out of line info boxes:
===============================
like:
<important>
<tip>
<caution>
<warning>

if you want to inform the reader about something special.
