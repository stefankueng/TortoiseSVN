Hacking the Docs
================

While you are working on the docs, please oberve the following rules for your markup.
The markup is processed by XSL Transformations, FO Processors and the like. Always
remember that you define the structure and leave the formatting to the processors
For more information about tags in docbook read http://www.docbook.org/tdg/index.html.
If you want to translate the german or french docs you have to enable UTF-8 BOM's in 
your editor.

Rules
=====
- Emphasis
  Don't use capitalization to emphasize,
  use <emphasis>Important</emphasis> instead

- Key / Mouse Actions
  If you want to say: "Press Alt-A to abort", use the following markup:
  Click on <action>ALT+A</action> to abort
  If you want to say: "Do a Right-Click to abort", use the following markup:
  Do a <action>Right-Click</action> to abort

- Gui Buttons
  If you want to say: "Click on OK to continue", use the following markup:
  Click on <guibutton>OK</guibutton> to continue

- Gui Menus
  If you want to say: "Select Commit from the TortoiseSVN menu", use the following markup:
  Select <menuchoice><guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu><guimenuitem>Commit</guimenuitem></menuchoice>

- Gui Labels / Fields
  If you want to say: "Select the URL from the URL Combobox", use the following markup:
  "Select the URL from the <guilabel>URL</guilabel> Combobox"

- User input, system output and properties are marked with <literal> like: 
  "Enter <literal>something</literal> to continue"
  "The <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property"

- Links:
  Use ulink for external links <ulink url="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">svn book</ulink>.
  Use this <xref linkend="tsvn-DUG-import-4"/> to reference internal sections.

- Lists
  A list is declared with <itemizedlist> and a listitem with <listitem>

- Mark Filenames with <filename>Hacking.txt</filename>

- Avoid quotes (" or ').
  Use <literal> instead, because normally you refer to input or output text

Use the out of line info boxes:
===============================
like:
<note>
<important>
<tip>
<caution>
<warning>

if you want to imform the reader about something special.
