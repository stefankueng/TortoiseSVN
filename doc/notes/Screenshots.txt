Grabbing Screenshots for TortoiseSVN Docs
=========================================
This file is a guide to grabbing screenshots for the user manual.
Although there are not many hard and fast rules, some screenshots need
care to set up as they are demonstrating a range of features.

To help with consistency, some of these instructions are presented
as a TortoiseProc.exe command line. These assume that the TSVN
bin directory is in the PATH and that you have a doc folder checked
out at C:\TortoiseSVN\Doc. Adjust the path according to your location.

If you do not already have a screen capture/image viewer program,
download a free copy of IrfanView from www.irfanview.com


General rules for all screenshots
=================================
Use PNG format
8 bit colour depth (256 colours)
Windows 7 default style preferred

Test Repository
===============
We now have a batch file to create a repository and some working copies
in various states of modification and conflict. In the test folder,
create a file called DocPath.txt which contains the path to your doc
folder, but with forward slashes and URI escaping of spaces and other
funny characters. Now simply run MakeTest.bat to create the test folders
in the 'temp' subfolder.

Instructions for each screenshot
================================
Authenticate.png
    You will have to clear authentication to make this one appear.
    Do this temporarily for the TSVN repo by renaming
    [Application Data]\Subversion\auth\svn.simple\f55fc06b366775f8c026407285be8070

BlameDialog.png
    Blame any file

ch02dia1-7.png
    These are 'borrowed' from the Subversion Book

Changelist.png
    Use the 'doc' test WC.
    Open the commit dialog and add dug_blame.xml to a new changelist 'Blame doc update'.
    Screenshot shows context menu for the changelist.
    Remove dug_blame.xml from the changelist.

Checkout.png
    Just pretend to checkout the TSVN doc folder:
    TortoiseProc.exe /command:checkout /path:"C:\TortoiseSVN\Doc" /url:"http://tortoisesvn.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc"

Commit.png
    Use the 'doc' test WC.
    Modify server.xml in the 'ext' folder
    Open the commit dialog for the 'doc' folder
    Type a message with spelling problem, eg.
        Explain the message recieve function
    Right click on dug_blame and include context menu in screenshot.
    This setup is also used for CommitSpellCheck.png and CreatePatch.png

CommitSpellcheck.png
    As above, but right click on the mis-spelled word to get the context menu.

CommitProgress.png
    Capture the progress dialog at the end of any commit.

CompareRevisions.png
    Show log for TortoiseSVN trunk
    Select two revisions from the top pane
    Right-click and select command "Compare revisions"

ContextMenuDirControl.png
    In explorer, right click on a versioned folder (eg. TSVN doc folder) and
    capture the main context menu and the large TSVN sub menu.
    You will probably have to capture the entire explorer window and
    then edit out everything except the context menus. Ideally, also edit
    out all non-TSVN items from the main context menu.
    Because of the manual editing, this item (and the next 3) is a bit of
    a pain and generally best left until just before a new release in case
    something else changes.

ContextMenuDirNoControl.png
    As above, but capture for an unversioned folder.

ContextMenuFileControl.png
    As above, but capture for a single versioned file.

ContextMenuFileIgnore.png
    As above, but capture for a single unversioned file.
    Expand the 'add to ignore list' entry.

Copy.png
    Open the branch/tag dialog for the TSVN doc folder and enter a
    fictitious URL for the target. It is easiest to copy and paste the
    source URL and edit /trunk/ to /branches_1.4.x/ or something like that.

CreatePatch.png
    Set up as for the commit dialog, but create a patch instead.
    The dialog shows the files selected for the patch.

ExplorerFileMenuShortCut.png
    Use the 'doc' test WC.
    In explorer, right click on dug_log.xml and 'Create shortcut'
    Select the newly created shortcut.
    Click on the explorer file menu and capture the menu which opens.
    There should be 3 TSVN entries (shortcut, shortcut-target and folder).
    Delete the shortcut when you're done.

ExportURL.png
    Right click on the TSVN doc folder and open the repo browser
    Select the doc folder in repo browser and export
    Enter a folder name in the Export directory box

    Right click on any unversioned folder and TSVN->import
    Make up a URL like http://svn.example.com/svn/paint/trunk
    Add a suitable message like 'Initial import of paint files'.

IssueTrackerQuery.png
    Install the example CS issue tracker plugin.
    Set up the plugin to work on your test docs folder.
    Open the commit dialog and click on the 'Choose Issue' button.
    Centre the plugin dialog over the commit dialog so that you can still
    see the 'choose issue' button.
    You will need a whole screen capture, then trim down to just the
    commit dialog area.

    Select the 'merge two trees' option and hit Next.

    eg the LogCaching branch.
    Enter the same revision number in both boxes.

    Start merge wizard and enter the final page.

MergeConflictCallback.png
    Use a fresh 'doc' test WC
