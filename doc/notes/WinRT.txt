Subversion client for WinRT/Metro/WinPhone
==========================================

A full svn client for the Win (phone) 8.1 interface would probably not make much
sense. An svn client is usually used as a tool, not as the main application.

But a CommitMonitor/Project Monitor type of client could be useful.

There's a repo-browser/logviewer app available in the store:
http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/metro-svn/a4eb3a49-c146-47c8-ac0f-dfb1fe6fd9b2
but it didn't work for me: showing the log for the TSVN repo failed completely,
browsing the repo only got to the root, browsing further down blocked.


Problems
--------
WinRT has a very limited set of APIs that are available, many APIs are not allowed
to be used in Store apps. Which is why simply compiling the svn libraries and
its dependencies does not work:
* OpenSSL uses a lot of APIs that are forbidden, e.g. LoadLibrary(), Winsock
* apr/apr-util uses Winsock as well, which is not available

Since the whole networking stack of svn relies on Winsock, porting those to be
compatible with WinRT would be a major effort.

I haven't tested all the other libraries that are necessary to compile svn, but
I expect similar problems there as well.


How to proceed
--------------
For now I think it's too risky and too much work to start a WinRT client.
And if we ever go there: for a CommitMonitor/ProjectMonitor type of app we
might best just implement the ra-layers in WinRT from scratch. We only need
file/dir-listing (for browsing), file downloads, show log.
Maybe creating a diff would be nice too.
