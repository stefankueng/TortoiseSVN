As of revision 2659, TSVN now can parse all the files listed and checked
in the commit dialog for words to use in the autocompletion list. This
is a very handy feature when writing log messages since it helps you
refer to changed methods, class names, ...

The parsing of the files is done with regexes, and those regexes are
kept in {ProgramFiles}\TortoiseSVN\bin in autolist.txt. In our source
tree, that file lives at trunk/src/TortoiseSVNSetup/include/autolist.txt

The installed file gets replaced whenever TSVN is upgraded (because bad
regexes can cause the commit dialog to crash), so anything you add there
will be lost on upgrade.

Versions of TSVN later than 1.4 look for an additional file at
%APPDATA%\TortoiseSVN\autolist.txt, which is where you can put user-
defined regexes in addition to the standard ones.

So here's how you can help:
- find a filetype/programming language you know well
- decide what of a typical file of that type you'd want in the
  autocompletion list. Usually, you'd want method/function names,
  class names, interface names. But maybe not variable names since
  then the autocompletion list could get just too big!
- write a regex to parse for those strings
- test your regex on as many files you can find
- improve the regex and test again.
- test the whole thing with TSVN directly
- send us your regex string with the filetype you want it to apply to,
  and maybe some testfiles too.

To help you with this task, there's a little tool to test your regex
strings on files located here:
http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/files/documents/406/20668/RegExpTest.exe
Just enter your regex string and drag the files you want to test it with
over the dialog. The parsed strings will be listed at the bottom of the
dialog.
Or with TortoiseSVN 1.7.0 and later, you can enter
c:\program files\TortoiseSVN\bin\TortoiseProc.exe /command:autotexttest
to get a test tool for those regex strings.

If you are unfamiliar with regular expressions, take a look at the online
documentation and tutorial at http://www.regular-expressions.info/

Note that TSVN also uses regex groups and you can specify the flags to
use in the autolist.txt file like this:
(MULTILINE|NOCASE|GLOBAL) .txt, .pic = (regex-string)
